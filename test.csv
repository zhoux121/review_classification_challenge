1,0,0,0,100,"I just found this recipe online after losing it for many years! I made this in 1993 and beyond for a few years and was devastated to lose it, probably in a move. It was so popular, I sold it at work and made muffins with it, and took it to many a potluck. I nearly had it memorized, but couldn&#39;t reconstruct it. Reading it now, each ingredient comes back to me. I reduced the sugar some, I recall. Thank you for posting it!",0
1,0,57,8,873,We have made this recipe several times and enjoy it! Sometimes have soggy rolls-how can I prevent this?,0
1,0,0,0,100,I made the exact recipe as is and it is wonderful everyone loves it...i do add a little cayenne pepper to the top while it&#39;s baking for looks,5
1,0,0,1,100,Have been on the hunt for the best Stuffed Pepper Soup and this is it!  I used a box of beef broth (and no added salt) for half of the water and a can of Italian tomato sauce.  Also added 3/4 cup orzo pasta.  I debated using the brown sugar but don&#39;t be afraid..it is delicious!,5
1,0,0,0,100,"I made this for my grandson&#39;s birthday.  I did not use this frosting as chocolate frosting was requested.  It did take a little longer to bake but the awful part was while baking in two 9&#34; pans the batter ran over the top and I had a huge mess in the bottom of the open.  I would have to have put it in two 8&#34; pans.  When I make this again, I will definitely use a 13 x 9 x 2&#34; pan.",4
1,0,0,0,100,"Best cake ever!  Been making this one since 1985 (it&#39;s a Mable Hoffman recipe, first showed up in the Ladie&#39;s Home Journal that year).  I also often will freeze the third layer, and tote the other two to whatever event needs a great chocolate cake.",5
1,0,0,1,100,"pretty good I made this for church gathering and everyone gobbled it up. I added some extra mayonnaise and it need a little more kick, so extra vinegar too.",4

1,0,10,5,287,"Lasagna is not a dish that originated in Italy.  So this is American Lasagna and it&#39;s delicious - it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be.  Lasagna comes from the Greeks - I actually make a Greek lasagna better known as Pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef  but when I want American Lasagna I make this recipe.   Did you know the Brits actually found a recipe for Lasagna from the 1390&#39;s?  Each country has perfected their own claim to Lasagna fame.  When the Italians make it in Northern Italy they do not use ricotta cheese, they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella.  Ricotta is used in the Southern region only, this is why many Italians in America use ricotta - most are descendants from Southern Italians.  So even Mario or Giada is making it wrong if you are from Tuscany.",5

1,0,0,0,100,My husband did not like this and I would use corn tortillas instead of flour.,2
1,0,0,0,100,I doubled this recipe and used more creamed corn. Jiffy cornbread is the best cornbread to use. This recipe is excellent. Very very tasty!!!!!!!,5

1,0,0,0,100,"AS IS only a 2 because there is no taste/flavor. I may make this again with these changes. 1) I&#39;d put the pineapple juice in the cake in place of the water. 2) I may tried putting a 2nd can of pineapple in the cake to  for more flavor. If that doesn&#39;t do it, then I could try the trifle as others suggested. This is something that &#34;feels&#34; light after a meal.",2

1,0,0,0,100,This is a great recipe and the only meat loaf recipe I use.  We like the use of sage and the flavor it gives. Makes a wonderful sandwich from leftovers.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"This was very good, but I forgot to trim the fat off the chops.  The casserole was a little too greasy.  I&#39;m going to try this with boneless skinless chicken breasts -- has anyone tried this?",4
1,0,9,7,671,"What a super easy recipe! I love cream of mushroom soup but had never made it from scratch. I’m with some other posters, it is a bit bland. On the first try I added more salt and pepper with a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic. It was delicious. I may try adding extra seasoning on the next round. Definitely adding this to my soup files!",5
1,0,1,0,193,"I actually made this for my son &amp; daughter-in-law, who just had a new baby, so was making some easy meals for them.  I made an extra for us.  It was so quick &amp;  easy to make.  I thought that it was delicious &amp; probably the best chicken pot pie that I&#39;ve ever had.  My husband said, &#34;I don&#39;t know what you did, but... &#34;it was better than any other I&#39;ve ever eaten&#34;.    I will definitely make this again &amp; freeze a few as well.",5

1,0,0,0,100,I have been making this for years. It is the best! Everyone loves it.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"I made this for Easter and everyone really liked it.  I also made a separate one with only potatoes, cheese, and bacon.  Both were delicious!  I used regular baking potatoes instead of red.  I will definitely make this again.",4
1,0,0,0,100,This is a winner. I used3 kinda of mushrooms ?? and a lot of extras. Sooo good??,5
1,0,0,0,100,Made as written.  It looked overcooked but tasted wonderful.  Has a nice dark sugarery crust (is that a word?),5

1,0,1,1,142,"A doctor it up a little bit;, less sugar and a scoosh of nutmeg. I bake and give away and I’m told this is the best apple pie ever",5
1,0,1,0,193,"I&#39;ve made this twice so far. It will be my go-to pumpkin bread recipe.  It&#39;s a very adaptable recipe and I&#39;ll probably make it a little different each time. I&#39;ll never use 1.5C of sugar, that&#39;s for sure. Today I used 3/4th cup and it&#39;s perfectly sweet.",5
1,0,0,0,100,I give it 5 stars for sure. Everyone loved these candies. I had a problem with the carmel running though. Any tips?,0
1,0,6,0,794,"Delicious! I am a huge fan of the &#34;dressing&#34; and the grapes are just a reason to make it. 😋  If I make this for a gathering, I&#39;ll add the pecans, but for just me and my husband, I can leave them off. I&#39;ve already shared this with my mom!",5

1,0,0,0,100,My husband loves this Banana Bread.  I often substitute chocolate chips for the walnuts and serve it as a dessert.,5
1,0,0,0,100,Just made this again &amp; WoW it is fantastic!  I did some modifications this time to try some new things out.  This recipe is great as is but the additions were nice &amp; changed it up a little.  I added 1 C. frozen corn to the meat/onions in the pan.  I added 4 cloves garlic chopped to the pan towards the end of cooking.  I used 2 C. Tostitos Mild Chunky Salsa (used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great).  I used 2 cans black beans.  Used 1 C. lite sour cream which I added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer.  I used 1/2 C. Zesty Italian dressing (Kraft).  Used 8 flour tortillas instead of 6 &amp; put it all in a 9X13 baking pan.  I used 8 oz. authenic mexican cheese blend already pre-shredded &amp; more cilantro because we love it!  This is again AMAZING &amp; would be great for any family meal or potluck.  I would precut it for a potluck though.  Cut with sharp knife first otherwise it will fall apart.  Fantastic!!,5
1,0,0,0,100,I made this recipe because of all of the great reviews.  I&#39;m not sure if I would make it again because I felt it was just ok,3
1,0,0,0,100,So easy and truly EXCELLENT.  My 3 year old asked for 3rd helpings and my husband told me it was the best meat he has ever eaten.  I can honestly say I don&#39;t think I would make a pot roast any other way after this!  I did up the water to one cup for more gravy.  Delicious.,5
1,0,2,0,253,"My family loved it!  I took the advice of another reviewer &amp; cut the sugar in half &amp; added an additional 2 cups of apples; the sweetness level was just right for us &amp; the amount of apples was perfect!  I used Cortland apples from a local orchard.   I&#39;d never made an apple crisp with a liquid poured over it &amp; was skeptical.  But, it was delicious!  This will be the apple crisp recipe I make from now on!  Thanks for sharing it with us.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"I omitted the green chilis, and I loved it.  Added some cheese and oyster crackers to my bowl and was delicious.  I am going to make this again and again.  Finally a chicken chili recipe that I can use.",0
1,0,0,0,100,"I&#39;ve had this recipe for a while but didn&#39;t make them until this year. Boy did I regret that! These were the best cupcakes I&#39;ve ever made. My boyfriend won&#39;t let me share them with anybody! I brought them to work and everyone wanted the recipe. I&#39;ll be making these every year for the rest of my life, more than likely. : )",5

1,0,0,0,100,"Very quick and EASY recipe.  I had to change up some of the recipe, but was still fantastic!  I substituted a few items for things I already had at home: Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth, I used real Mayo instead of sour cream, and I diced baby carrots instead of grating them.",5
1,0,0,0,100,I think this soup would be good make with chicken or even sausage. I love the thickness of it. It is so creamy and rich with flavor,5
1,0,4,2,235,"Thanks for the inspiration! I changed it up a bit and used red onion, green and red bell peppers, skipped the cucumber and water chestnuts. I also cheated and used Marie’s coleslaw dressing to make this in a pinch. Lastly, I added Craisins.  This served a crowd and the combo of crunchy slaw and pasta was delicious! Next time, I’ll try the homemade dressing.",5
1,0,0,0,100,Since I tried this recipe it is my go-to meatloaf. Everyone enjoyed.,5
1,0,0,0,100,Very good and so easy!!! Just like my mom used to make!!!,5
10,0,0,1,100,"These were really good.  I had a few options for everyone.  They chose a tortilla, tortilla chips or rice to spoon this mixture over.  Great either way!",4

1,0,0,0,100,"I used large cremini mushrooms, organic low sodium broth and soy creamer for delicious NON dairy version-then I thickened that and used it for a green bean casserole!!",0
1,0,1,1,142,I have been making this for years. It is always a hit. I make it for pot luck dinners too and I never have left overs!!! I use regular Lasagna noodles though instead of the no cook lasagna and it turns out great. It&#39;s so easy and frees up my day to get other things done. Everyone things I work  for hours over making it. The left overs freeze great. I was pleasantly surprises at that.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"Definitely would add cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice to jazz it up.  Tastes a lot like a apple pie crumble.",4
1,0,1,0,193,I searched the web for a peach cobbler recipe and was glad to find this one.  The recipe is easy to make and absolutely delicious.  My picky grandson had four servings and everyone raved about it.  Thank you.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"It doesn&#39;t look anything like the picture, but it&#39;s EXCELLENT!!",5
1,0,0,0,100,This is a go to recipe for me.  I always multiply the recipe because it’s so easy to freeze. Just the thing when you want to bring a comfort food dinner to folks. The frozen version tastes just as good and it times I’ve substituted ingredients with good results.,0
1,0,0,1,100,"This recipe is delicious!!  I made a few substitutions: lean ground turkey, low sodium black beans, lowfat ricotta cheese (no refried beans), whole wheat tortillas and lowfat cheese. I had to cook it a little longer; 30 minutes covered and 10-15 minutes uncovered- I like my tortillas crispy.",4
1,0,0,0,100,"This was an instant favorite! Instead of the cookie crust, I broke up some leftover brownies. I also layered mine in a clear, glass bowl, alternating each layer at least twice...it just dressed it up a little and added some eye-appeal.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"My kids said the word &#34;amazing&#34; countless times tonight.  It was a big hit!  In addition to being family friendly, it&#39;s party worthy.  A definite keeper!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"I tripled the recipe and used two 9x13 glass pans.  I also let the liquid boil for a few minutes which I think contributed to thickening.  I like to freeze individual portions.  I was a bit concerned when pouring the liquid on top because it seemed like it was too much, but it worked out well.  I like the way it bakes into a mixture of cake and sauce.  The flavor of nutmeg and cinnamon is wonderful.  I&#39;ve tried many peach cobbler recipes and this will not be my favorite.  Yummy!!",5
1,0,0,0,100,Easy and delicious.  I rolled mine in raw sugar and it made them look nice and gave them a little sugary crunch.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"This is a new favorite in my house.  It&#39;s so quick and easy, but tastes like it took all day.    I modified the recipe a bit - I bake, then shred the chicken.  I also leave out the onions (I hate the texture, but like the taste so I use onion powder).  I also hate the texture of green chiles, so I puree them in the food processor.",5

1,0,18,6,347,"By substituting eggplant, zucchini and/or mushrooms for the chicken, this could be a very good vegetarian casserole. You could also use any or all of those ingredients to &#34;bump&#34; up the dish, if you like those ingredients.

1,0,0,0,100,"Just an OK recipe to me.  A rather heavy bread, not light like most of my quick bread recipes are.  Also, way too many nuts for my taste.  Will return to my &#34;go to&#34; banana nut recipe",3
1,0,5,5,206,"Gerri, the oven may have been to high for the yeast and it died, keep in warm moist area, about 80 degrees.  you can put them in the oven on minimal heat but if you do, put them on a large baking dish thats got water on it to keep the humidity up.  Dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan, but not over, otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan.   Carrie, sugar is the simplest of the &#39;starches&#39; that yeast needs to form, you can use honey or even corn starch,  sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest.  if you use honey or starch it will take longer.  if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour, that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour.  Remember not to put yeast into too hot of liquid mix or it make kill it.",0

Thank you to whomever submitted it.",5

1,0,0,0,100,"great recipe! My bread turned out perfect! I do beat my bread down  twice though to get a more even mix. Also, in the recipe it says 3 cups and on the side of the recipe it says over 6 cups. The  6 cups is the correct one!! If you cant get your bread to rise, it&#39;s because you&#39;re missing over 3 cups of flour!!!",5
1,0,0,1,100,I have been making this recipe for 5 years since it was first published.  It has become my trademark dish for family &amp; potluck gatherings &amp; everyone requests the recipe.

1,0,0,0,100,"I have tried many pot pie recipes and this is hands down the best. I clicked on some of the other reviews that were 1/2 stars because I couldn&#39;t imagine why no one would like this. My best guess if you think it is too flour-y or too much thyme, then maybe try again because honestly I make these for anyone who is sick, birthdays, neighbors....and they rave constantly.  Maybe a misstep in the recipe was done.  The directions are correct and I like that they have the  frozen bake time! It is listed separate for easy understanding!  I love being able to have a frozen option such as this instead of soup/chili all the time.",5

10,0,0,0,100,"This is a fantastic recipe!   I make it just as written except I sub fat-free half and half for milk.  Because of my family&#39;s taste preferences, I sometimes omit potatoes and use frozen carrot/pea mix instead of fresh carrots.  I often add frozen green beans as well.  I use unsalted chicken stock to reduce sodium.  These taste perfectly fresh after several months in the freezer.  I wrap them in plastic wrap, then put in a gallon ziplock to freeze.

1,0,6,0,374,"This was my first foray into baking an apple pie. I&#39;ve done lots of different cakes, pies, and cupcakes, but I&#39;ve been a limited intimidated with the apple pie. Well, my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so, it was the right time to just go for it. I chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward. I did read through many of the reviews, which are very mixed--from best pie to worst pie. Honestly, that made me a little nervous, but I decided to remain positive and give it a shot. The result was spectacular!!! I had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy. He said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice. I took the next slice, and I was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how  well everything came out.  I will note that I followed the directions, without any changes. I used only Granny Smith apples and I didn&#39;t have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough. The pie&#39;s taste is amazing. I thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly. Honestly, the hardest part for me was making the crust, which I also decided to do for the first time. I was actually worried most about the double crust, but it somehow all worked out. Phew! I would definitely recommend this recipe. It&#39;s worth taking a chance.",5

I made the rue in a saucepan instead of small skillet and then added the milk to it.  I then added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the milk mixture and whisked it in so there where no lumps.  Then I added that to the beef and potato mixture in the 3qt saucepan.  I mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added 2 tbsp. of Dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel.  I also used reduced sodium broth and didn&#39;t add the added salt at the end of the recipe in order to keep sodium to a minimum.,5

1,0,9,3,310,"My husband&#39;s Uncle Wally introduced us to Pig Pickin&#39; Cake over 30 years ago. He explained that it&#39;s called a Pig Pickin&#39; Cake because it was the traditional dish brought to a pig picking in his neck of North Carolina- a pig picking being a &#34;neighborhood&#34; event that follows a pig roasting: After the pig is roasted, the women get together to pick and shred the meat from the carcass, for the making of traditional Carolina BBQ. Our family&#39;s version includes a golden butter cake mix (box), 1/2c oil, the fruit from acan of mandarins and 4T of the juice, and 3 whole eggs. The frosting is 20can of crushed pineapple- not drained- with 1 box instant vanilla pudding mixed in. After about 5 mins, fold the whipped topping (12oz)  into the pudding/pineapple.

Each :cumin, chilli powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and a scant TOregano. (1/4t. salt is optional. )  I round up the cumin just a bit and go a bit scant one the chili powder .But a mix of regular and  chipolte chilli powder  is good too. That will taste just like the envelope or BETTER according to reviews  Plus no sodium. Also look for fat free refried beans... 85 % lean or ground turkey (needs a tad more seasoning) lowers the fat.  These swaps do not chang the flavor at all. ADD in stuff  include corn., jalapenos . Olives. .

After she passed away, I was unable to replicate it, but THIS is DARN close.  I only use granny smith apples, I use less sugar and brown sugar (slightly less than half a cup per pie), a bit more cinnamon, about the same nutmeg and flour. I skip the ginger, as I don&#39;t think the pie needs it. I don&#39;t care for a pie that is TOO sweet, so I am pretty liberal with the lemon juice.  (I might add a teaspoon more of flour, depending on how crazy I went with the lemon juice.)  I generally don&#39;t sugar the crust, but that is my preference.  I made two apple and two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year, and needless to say, there were NO leftovers.  To those that have a problem with the filling being too wet, I suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples.  The peel should be dark green.  If the texture of the apple is &#34;mealy&#34;, it is over ripe and will probably be too wet.  Thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom.",5

Very difficult to find a gluten free banana bread recipe that creates a very moist, tasty outcome. Easy to make and very flavorful.  I love that it makes two loaves and you don&#39;t need to put butter on the finished product for more moisture.  I would like to try some other alterations like coconut oil, yogurt option, brown sugar or honey, (less sugar) options as healthier choices.  But, it&#39;s a must try recipe.

However, I forgot to do that, and instead just made it as-is.  When it came out of the oven, I was disappointed.  It was a big mess, and there was definitely too much liquid.  I put all the leftovers in the fridge for another night.When I pulled them back out a couple days later, I have to say that I fell in love with this dish!!  It tastes a million times better cold, and the cold actually helped it firm up; it was no longer liquid-y.  It reminded me of a delicious bread pudding (almost).  I can understand why some people are disappointed, but give this a chance as-is.  If you don&#39;t like it, then make adjustments for your next trial ;)",5

1,0,0,9,100,"Although I am sure that some people would like this,it is not traditional in any sense of the word.  It is fusion cooking. This is Tex-Mex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional Mexican food made to please those North of the border.  Here, in Texas, people put beef in just about everything.  We always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladas.Traditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author noted.The sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products.  I can tell you with authority that most restaurants and Mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce.   California, Northern and Central Mexico don&#39;t use tomatoes in this way traditionally.As we live in Texas, I encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional Mexican food.  Some are o.k. but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation.   The same is true with many Mexican families here.For my enchilada sauce I only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent, then I add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least 4 minutes.   I then add the broth (Better Than Bouillon Chicken) and simmer for 30 minutes.  I don&#39;t add salt as there is enough in the broth.

I’m not sure what you’ve shared is accurate. It’s my understanding that both stock and broth are made from the bones, the difference is in the length of time they are cooked. Bone broth is cooked longer with the intention of leeching more nutrients from the bones. Chicken stock is more for flavour, where as broth is more for health benefits. I’m open to being challenged on this, just wanted to put forth a different perspective. Thanks.",4

I use pork steaks instead of pork chops and I cook them for about 3 hours at 300 degrees.  the pork chops come out fall apart tender and the potatoes are nice and yummy.  Two pork steaks and potatoes give my wife and i enough for two meals.  But these are really good.  Brown your pork in a cast iron skillet that is really hot so you get the nice sear.  I have also browned them on the grill and then put them in the oven which is really good as well.,5

I baked mine in a 15 x 10 pan per the recipe, and had to make extra frosting, as there was not enough to cover the top (even with a very thing layer). 6 oz. of cream cheese is a strange amount. I used the whole 8 oz. brick, and added the proportion of powdered sugar and milk needed to finish topping the bars. I wonder if there&#39;s a typo in the recipe? Should it be 6 oz. of cream cheese, or should it have been 16 oz? Would have been plenty of frosting (maybe too much) for a 9x13 using 6 oz, but not enough for the 15x10.",4

I didn&#39;t cook my filling. I went old school and dumped the raw apples, cornstarch, and everything in a bowl, mixed it together, and it baked up just fine. One tip I think you may find useful is you can also use instant oatmeal packets. Just cut back on the brown sugar for the topping (I used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar).  Also, I doubled the recipe for the crust and the topping using 2 packets of Apple Cinnamon oatmeal for each, for a deep dish pie. I just found that saving a cup wasn&#39;t enough for the topping, but boy was it delicious! I used a combination of 3 each Jonathan and granny smith apples and it turned out mighty tasty.

The only difference is that I use 2 TBSP of fresh cilantro in place of the oregano - and 1 1/2 cups of shredded Monterey Jack in place of the whipping cream - and cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup.   I also cut back the pepper and cayenne pepper because my family doesn&#39;t like foods too &#34;hot&#34;...,5

I give it 4 stars only bc it was a little too sweet for me as well. And without the sauce the meat was pretty bland, although my husband liked the fact that the meat wasn&#39;t overly seasoned bc the sauce had a great taste. The only thing I may do next time is season the meat a little more and probably not put as much brown sugar. But I wouldn&#39;t make many changes bc my family (husband and 2 kids) LOVED IT. I paired it with some mashed potatoes and green beans. Overall a great meal.",4

Also, instead of bacon slices, I chopped the bacon into pieces before cooking it, and just piled it on top! The only thing I will do differently next time is put the cheese on top of the chicken, then the onions and bacon on top of the cheese so everything sticks together better. I highly recommend this dish.",5

1,0,0,0,100,I&#39;ve been making this soup for over 10 years.  It&#39;s delicious!  But my original recipe I printed from this website calls for 8 oz of Velveeta.  I think when it&#39;s made with more Velveeta it tastes grainy.  I also always use 1-1 1/2 lb of ground beef.  Usually I&#39;m cooking for a large crowd so it goes farther.,5
1,0,0,1,100,"I used the recipe as a starting point and it turned out incredible.  First I added 1 Teaspoon each of ground cayenne, ground ancho chile, and ground chipotle chile.  This gave it a deeper smokie chili flavor without adding much heat.  Since a added more powders I also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste.  I pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them.  When cooking the  chicken I started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side, removed them and let them rest of 20 minutes.  This left the chicken with nice grill marks and raw in the center.  I then sliced them into even stips and finished the cooking with the vegatables.  By cooking the chicken twice I could control the timing of the fajitas for the party we were having.",5

I have no trouble with the candy falling apart, contrary to what some of the other reviewers have stated. Cutting into the chocolate with a warm, sharp knife will help make the cutting easier. I also add less heavy cream (almost by half) when melting the caramels. I followed other reviewers’ advice on that and it did prevent the caramel from oozing between the layers.

For this recipe, I made muffins instead of a loaf, and for that I baked the muffins for 30 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time for them. The end result was very moist, and delicious muffins. It made 12 muffins (I filled the cups almost to the top, so they were quite full).. I usually cut the sugar on recipes, especially when they call for one cup (it just seems excessive). I considered using honey as a substitute for the sugar, and may try the recipe again doing just that.

Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times if you&#39;re using a stand mixer.  I made the following changes/additions, and the richness of the flavor was extremely popular with friends.  3/4 tsp salt 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tsp Lebkuchengewurz (German Gingerbread Spice)  I use a #40 disher for consistency.

Made it as outlined in the directions; I was impressed with how light and fluffy it turned out. Cooking time was under 45 minutes. Both of my girls stated that it reminded them of cornbread stuffing. Will definitely be making this again !",5

1,0,0,0,100,"This soup is so good! It&#39;s really quick and easy to make...great for a busy mom. I added closer to a cup and a half of cheese, just to finish out the bag (plus I love cheese) and the flavor was really nice. Great soup to beat the winter blues :)",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Outstanding recipe!  I just made this for dinner.  We loved it and agree that it is a keeper.  I did not dice the bacon. I cooked it until crisp.  I crumbled half of it and added to the pot with the potatoes and broth.  We used the remaining to crumble into our bowls.  I sauted the onions and carrots in about a tbs of bacon drippings before I added the potatoes and broth.  I used celery seed because I did not have fresh celery, but I plan to use fresh celery next time.  Also, to increase volume,  used 4 cups and milk and a little more than 4 tbs. flour.  My husband likes his soup a little thick.  This recipe is very versatile.  I am already planning when I can make this again, and maybe use ham instead of bacon.  Another great recipe for my collection!",5

1,0,0,0,100,I have been looking for a strawberry cake recipe similar to the one my mother used to make to no avail. Mamaw must be the right age as this recipe is spot on. Ha loads of real strawberry flavor. My family went nuts for it. They said it was even better than the best bakery in town.,5
1,0,0,1,100,"Very Good Mexican Flavored Fajitas... Hubby, Son  &amp; Grandbaby LOVED them.. Next time I&#39;ll add Black Beans per hubby&#39;s request... I did Saute Chicken in a Tab. Spoon of Butter &amp; used Veg. Oil for marinade as well... Will Defiantly be making again",5
1,0,1,0,193,I did the recipe to the T because I saw a review complain that everyone tweaks the recipe and reviews their version rather than the original recipe and they are right. So I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious. I will critique it though. Ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste. It definitely came out liquid-y however I found when you let it cool for about 45 mins the liquid becomes less runny. I used a Pillsbury pie crust. Phenomenal. I did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery. Didn’t really change anything. But the pie is truly delicious without adding or subtracting any ingredients.,5

I would suggest rolling them to at least 1 1/2&#34; balls (or more a pinch more); otherwise; they will &#34;poof&#34; instead of flatten out.  Bake at 10 minutes, tops!

1,0,0,0,100,"I might be in the minority, but this cheesecake was not as good as I thought it would be. I am confused by the name because it tastes nothing like a peanut butter cup.  The peanut butter flavor is hardly evident and the fudge poured on top doesn&#39;t add much to the flavor.  Except for the pb cups for garnishes, where is the comparison to a pb cup?  The crust came out hard, too and I didn&#39;t overbake it.  I just was not thrilled with this cheesecake. It&#39;s not worth all the trouble, so I don&#39;t think I would bother making it again.",3

I also used a package of frozen peas and carrots. Makes a super-creamy pot pie, enough for 2 pies. Be sure to vent your pies on top, they need to let out steam. Mine cracked on top, but who cares, it was fantastic!!",5

1,0,0,1,100,"Absolutely yummy! Made it twice over the weekend. I omitted the carrots, mushrooms, &amp; crumbled bacon to suit my husband&#39;s taste and just used shredded cheddar cheese instead of process cheese and it was excellent.

Definitely is going into the &#34;keeper&#34; file.",5

1,0,0,0,100,"This is easy to make and delicious. I pretty much follow the recipe, but am careful with the green chiles. If you use Rotel tomatoes with chilis, you have enough spice as far as I am concerned. Usually the soup becomes spicier as it sits.",5

1,0,2,8,125,Horrible recipe.  I am actually quite surprised it turned out so horribly. I spent $30 on all the ingredients and almost knew it would turn out amazing due to all the great reviews and five star rating. There was not nearly enough sauce to call it lasagna. The flavors were way too strong and the pork sausage was the wrong choice. There was also not enough lasagna noodles in this recipe. So many things I didn&#39;t like about this dish. What a waste of food and time. Don&#39;t waste your time.,1

Also, I would suggest adding chopped nuts to the batter--walnuts or pecans--maybe a 1/2 cup, depending on your preference.Also, for the frosting, I think you would run into problems adding the melted butter, brown sugar and milk with the confectioners sugar (as a preference, I would subsitute skim milk for the 2%).  I would do the icing a bit differently.  Warm the milk and brown sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolves.  Soften butter slightly in the microwave, then place in a stand mixer and mix until smooth.  Add confectioners sugar and mix.  Add cooled brown sugar/milk mixture to the above and mix until the frosting is combined.   Add additional confectioners sugar to achieve a spreadable consistency for frosting.",5

I just fold my ingredients together and it stays nice and fluffy and is plenty to cover a 13x9 pan. I&#39;ve also had an issue with the jello mixture leaking through to the pretzel layer but I know each time it happened, I didn&#39;t make sure the cream layer went all the way to the edges. That is important. But if it does leak through, it&#39;s still pretty darn tasty.",5

You can really half the sauce to the same amount of pasta OR you can add in some extras like broccoli or ham etc. I sometimes like the extra sauce so I will make an extra cup of macaroni to the regular sauce.

1,0,2,0,253,I just made this and it is VERY good. Unfortunately I did not have small pans so I made it in a bunt cake pan and I failed. It was so moist it fell apart.

1,0,10,1,380,"Brown the chops then bake for an hour?  I would think this would overcook the chops.  Chops are best at 145° f,  which is USDA safe for today&#39;s pork.  I have found browning is often sufficient to nearly reach this temp.  Cooking according to this recipe is a throwback to when a pork chop had to be cooked until it was dry. Cooking above 145°f squeezes the internal fat and juice out of the meat fibers as they contract. The hotter the meat, the more squeezing.  Pork today is much leaner than years ago when it had to be cooked much higher to be safe to eat (to avoid Trichinosis).  I suggest baking the potatoes and sauce first then add the browned meat maybe the last 15 minutes depending on the internal temperature of the browned chops.  Ideally, pull when the meat reaches 145°f.",0

I have added a pinch of salt a few times, other times I have poked holes with a chopstick  and poured in jello, and I have at times dumped a bunch of cocoa powder in with the dry ingredients.  They have all turned out great!  I like this cake because it is structurally sound and can withstand icing like a champ. Use a long bread knife to slice off the slight dome. When I use buttercream I do a thin crumb coat, stick it in the fridge, wash a couple of dishes and then the do the real icing. Beautiful every time!",5

Of course I had to eat my first serving before it had cooled completely with melting vanilla ice cream on top. So delish, and I know it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors blend together.

Instead of sugar I have use Truvia cane sugar blend which only requires 1/2 the amount of sugar and has 75% fewer calories than regular sugar.  I also used 3 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as suggested in other reviews plus an extra sprinkle or two.  When I make this in a 11X15 pan I make a recipe and a half so  they do not come out thin.  Or I use a 9 X13 pan and bake for 30 - 35 minutes.   Instead of cream cheese frosting I just use a can of coconut pecan frosting instead.,0

I&#39;ve made clam chowder many times and this recipe was close to how I&#39;ve made it in the past, but with a few additions, like the garlic and thyme. I was hesitant at first to add them, but I gave it a whirl. Everyone raved about how good it was! I had to tweak it just a little to use what I had on hand.

I was really worried about putting it all in one pan, because I hate partially cooked banana bread. This was banana bread, not pudding, and I liked very much. Great flavor.  However, I did cut back on the sugar (only 3/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white) and substituted applesauce for oil. Didn&#39;t have buttermilk onhand so I just used milk and put some butter in for flavor. My dd and I are more than happy with the result.Raised up to a beautiful loaf of bread.  I don&#39;t know if it helped that I whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure I didn&#39;t have banana globs. I will continue to do that.Cons- considering how sweet it is, I would not follow the recipe sugar recommendation.Bake time for my loaf was too long, and I only had it in for 50 minutes. I was glad it was baked through, but if this had been for gifts, I would not have shared.  The ends will be way too tough and overdone. It is very tough about a half to an inch around. If I would have gone the full 1 hr 20 minutes it would have been like a gummy bear.Overall, love it.  Going back for my second slice now!",4

I added another 1 tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasn&#39;t enough ( this took the flavor from just ok to yummy), and I was out of peas so I used cut green beans.  Prep time took me a little longer than I expected but was worth it in the end because I get two pies out of the deal.  I also ran short on crust (I had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie, so I only had 3 and needed 4), so instead of fully covering both pies, I just used cookie cutters on the 3rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes; kids loved it.  Filling comes out firm so it doesn&#39;t spill all over.  Also, even though boxed crust says to cook at 450, I did what the recipe said and did 425 for 35 mins (in gas oven) and it was perfect.

Pilsbury recently came out with a gluten free yellow cake mix that is made in a 9x13  pan so I figured I would give it a try.  First of all let me say that the cake baked up fabulously.  In fact I followed the cake recipe only changing to a gluten free cake mix.  I did make the frosting with a 12 oz. size whipped cream.  I had some left over and and figured why not.  This cake was so moist and delicious.  Even better the second day.  If you need to eat gluten free go ahead and make this cake.  I know I will make this cake again and again.

1,0,3,1,235,"This is a fantastic recipe.  I&#39;d been craving porcupine meatballs, a memory from childhood.  I also babysit my great-grandson once a week and wanted something for lunch that might appeal to a 2 1/2 year old.  I followed the instructions to the letter except for the celery salt.  I had some, but I couldn&#39;t remember how old it was so I omitted that ingredient.  The meatballs were perfect...the rice perfectly cooked and the sauce was thick and savory.  I only meant to sample them as they are to be our lunch tomorrow.  I put three on a saucer and ended up going back for three more.  (I&#39;m actually tempted to go back a 3rd time.)  I&#39;ve copied the recipe and added it to my notebook of favorites.  Someone suggested that the ones who complained of undercooked rice might have made the meatballs too big.  I simmered mine exactly an hour and the rice was just right.",5

It was 10 degrees and snowing, so today was the day.I had to make it dairy-free, so substituted the butter with bacon fat, and just used a bit more broth, and the liquid from the corn (i used canned, not frozen), to replace the milk; total abot 4.5 cups liquid.   Next time I think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk; all we had in the fridge was almond milk, and I didn&#39;t think that would work well.I also cooked down some portobello &#39;shrooms  (about two cups before cooking) in the pan first, and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions.   I pretty much followed all the other measurements.  Oh, added a bit of ground clove, too.It was really great.  My two boys &amp; wife loved it; it was gone in minutes.  I made just one pie  (only had one box of crusts) in an extra deep 10&#34; stoneware pie pan, and still have enough filling left over for probably another small pie.

I used Red Gold Petite Diced Tomatoes with Lime Juice and Cilantro, which is located with all the other kinds of canned diced tomatoes, and it worked out very well.

I just used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.

I used browned breakfast sausage and 12 eggs.  I didn&#39;t have Swiss cheese so I didn&#39;t use it and truth be told, we didn&#39;t miss it.  I think the extra cheese would have made it too rich and greasy.  I baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in my oven (likely due to the extra eggs).  The addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise, but I didn&#39;t even notice it was there.  If anything, it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry.  This is a great gluten-free recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread.  I also prepped this dish in a pan and let it sit overnight before baking in the morning.  Next time, I might add a small can of green chiles to the mix.  This will be my go-to recipe for breakfast casserole!",5

At the end of the cooking time it still was not done per the toothpick method.  I put it back in the oven and actually forgot about it.  I&#39;m guessing it was half an hour later when I realized I had a cobbler in the oven.  I ran to the kitchen expecting to see smoke coming from the oven and a burnt cobbler inside.  But it was perfect, a nice golden brown crust.  I was using a glass pan and it looked like it was soupy under the topping, but after setting for a little bit the juice thickened up.

I mix at least a cup or so of chopped walnuts or pecans in instead of sprinkling over the top, and I didn&#39;t care so much for the brown sugar, so don&#39;t use it at all.

1,0,0,0,100,Really easy. Love. Virtually no cleanup. Love more. I added some seasonings and such to the sauce but just to spice things up. Good concept but we were disappointed overall.

They weren&#39;t as moist as I had imagined from the reviews. I think I will make them bigger next time. I don&#39;t believe I made them big enough for the moistness. The carmel frosting is DEFINITELY worth the time and effort it takes to make it. I know I will use it on cakes and other things. It is DELICIOUS! I put the left over frosting in the fridge to put on brownies or something later. Or just eat like carmel. Thank you for the healthy alternative to normal cupcakes.

Provolone is similar to mozzarella, but the instructions call for provolone AND mozzarella. Note the recipe also calls for 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese. No where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned. Finally, the sauce is to be simmered for one hour. Unless you want it burned, don&#39;t plan on that.

It&#39;s really one of those things that sounds strange in your head. . Chili with chicken?  Hrm.. I dunno.  Just try it.  It makes you nervous to try it, because it seems odd, but once you try it, it&#39;s awesome!  No one in my family are huge onion people, so I always get a small onion and probably only use 3/4 of it, and I chop them up really tiny.  This way the onions are not overpowering, but I think it would be missing something without them, so I wouldn&#39;t leave them out.  ",5

First, I use only fresh veggies (except for the peas and pearl onions). It adds time but fresh carrots, parsnips, and Yukon Golds make a difference. Next, I add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute. To keep this flavorful I roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned. (Much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock, upping the flavor considerably.)  I also add a glug of sherry (or white wine, whichever is handy) to the simmering sauce.  Finally, I use the TOF site&#39;s buttery, flaky pie crust as the topper. It doesn&#39;t take long to make (and I only let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes) and is delicious on this pie. Yes, I&#39;ve increased the work and time but if you do, this is likely the best pot pie that&#39;s going to come out of your kitchen.",5

I added a lot more carrots and celery, around 1 cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves. I found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time I made it so next time I added the celery to the soup base 3 minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower. I also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce. i do like some kick to my soups so I added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time.

1,0,0,0,100,Phenomenal! The sauce was very good and spiced just right with just a little bit of zing with the hot pepper. We used Penzey&#39;s Chinese Five Spice Powder.

The second night I served with sour cream and enchilada sauce and it was much better but still not something that I would make it again. IF I did make it again I would make some changes one of which would be to incorporate the sour cream and the enchilada sauce into the layers. I would liked to have given this 2 ½ stars. It was not awful so I did not want to give it 2 stars just not that special. It does make a lot.,3

Instead of hot fudge topping stirred into the chocolate layer, I melted dark chocolate into some milk and stirred it into 1/3 of the batter. I left 1/3 plain, and I stirred the peanut butter into the other 1/3. I layered them in the pan, chocolate on bottom, plain in the middle, and PB on top. I baked it about an hour and 10 minutes. Tomorrow I&#39;ll melt chocolate in milk again and put it on top as a ganache, with PB cups chopped on top. (I used the recipe on this page to make GF PB cups: https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/homemade-peanut-butter-cups.)

I had to use bread flour because I was out of all-purpose (crazy, I know). I also used brown sugar instead of white. I used 3 fresh peaches, peeled/sliced and added 3/4 cup of fresh blueberries. Upon reading the reviews I decided to go with my own topping recipe.... I used a half stick of butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a splash of milk. It made a saucy caramel. I drizzled half of it over the batter and baked it at 400 for appx. 30 min. Until the top was browned and I could stick a toothpick in and not have any batter on it. VERY VERY GOOD.",4

I used 93% lean ground turkey instead of 90%  ground beef + used the entire 1.25 lb package instead of the 1 lb of ground beef called for in the recipe since I didn&#39;t want to freeze the extra 1/4 lb by itself.    I don’t like Italian dressing so used 1/3 cup v-8 juice instead of ¼ c It dressing.  Next time I will boost it to 1/2 or 2/3 c if I use the extra gr. turkey again.

1,1,24,7,797,"I think that part of what makes this an inconsistent recipe is the nature of the coconut flakes themselves - you can get a lot of variation between different cup measurements because of the way they take up space. Rather than going by volume - I went by weight, using a single package that weighed 7 oz. 

With this, I scaled up the amount of each ingredient - 1/2 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, 3/4ths tsp of vanilla, and three egg whites. The result was a puffy, toasty cookie that didn&#39;t spread. I had to bake it a bit longer at 325 as well - maybe set an 18-20 minute timer and check to see if the tops are toasty.",0

I also had less than half the onion called for, but I had green onions growing in my garden and used about a cup of those in place of one of the onions. I ended up adding 1 extra can of clams.. first reason was because I bought a pallet of them on clearance. Yeah. I thought it was a good move. And I wanted the extra clams because I was short on that clam juice. -- Also, I&#39;m going to try it again lower carb by only using 1 small potatoes and then chopped cauliflower and I might try cream cheese in place of the flour.

I usually use a hand mixer on a low setting but this recipe said &#34;combine&#34; therefore I used a whisk until all was combined.   I needed this for our Easter dinner. Now I need to go to the supermarket to buy a cake. I will cut it in pieces later to see if it tastes any good. I  can&#39;t serve it as is. I am not too sure if I should even bother making the icing. This turned out to be an expensive cake re: the guinness beer that no one will drink.,1

I added a couple of quick grates of nutmeg--be careful not to overdo this as a tiny bit goes a long way. A little bit of thyme would be a good idea, too.

Just the right amount of tart and sweet. TIP FOR ALL: If you dont want runny pies heres what to do; Mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice, let sit for at least 30 minutes, dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan, boil it gently for about 5-10 minutes to form a syrup (you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed) let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar, mix well then add your flour. This works every single time with every kind of pie. You will not have any more runny pie filling. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",5

I added some snipped fresh rosemary and chives to the sauce because we love fresh herbs.  I served over zucchini noodles and asparagus that were sautéed in olive oil, garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  It was delightful.  The only change I will make next time is to double the sauce.  We would have enjoyed more over our &#34;zoodles&#34;.   Would serve this to company!",5
1,0,0,2,100,This recipe has become one of my Family Favorites!  It makes a great Meatless Monday dinner ... I just  omit the sausage and add a package of cream cheese (cut into cubes) 5 minutes before serving.  Allow the cream cheese to melt and stir into the soup for added richness.,5
1,0,0,1,100,I needed to come up with a quick dinner tonight. A friend posted this recipe on her FB page and it looked delicious. I used chicken breast instead of thighs and heated the marinade to pour over the chicken. I also used it on the chicken as it cooked on my stove top grill pan. It was a big hit! I served it over RiceARoni chicken flavored pasta. It would&#39;ve been better had I had the time to allow it to marinate. This one&#39;s a keeper for sure!,5

The rest I followed exactly.  I let it rest for about 1 hour, before cutting into it and just reheated pieces in the microwave.

Also for the sugar I let my half cups measures be slightly short, and it didn&#39;t turn out too sweet. Also for the ginger, instead of powder I used paste and slightly more since its fresh. I used 4 granny Smith, and 2 honeycrisp apples. The results were fabulous. I&#39;ve made apple pie in the past using recipes found here or there and the flavor was always missing something.

I also use the spices to taste  -  that&#39;s not nearly enough salt and pepper.  My mom always added a dash of nutmeg to her potato salad and I do too.  It adds just a little different flavor but don&#39;t use too much - just a dash or two (maybe equals about 1/8 tsp or so).  I know a dash is different for everyone!  If I&#39;m feeling lazy or don&#39;t have a lot of time, I sometimes add the pre-cooked bacon bits.  This is very similar to the kind we grew up with.",4

I made a big mess in the kitchen &amp; ended up with dry cake  mixture all over the place &amp; myself, and despite trying to be careful I made the same big mess while mixing the frosting.

I needed to bake them about 25 minutes to get a bit of golden color, but they came out EXACTLY as pictured and described. I have 36 beautiful and delicious macaroons to take to an event this evening.  I will definitely come back to this recipe.  I found these to be a little *too* sweet for my taste, so I&#39;ll try it with less sugar next time.  But I wanted to let others know that there is NO NEED to bother with whipping the egg whites.  I had a little trouble getting them off the first pan, but I think that&#39;s because I let them cool a little before transferring them to a wire rack.  For the second pan, I transferred them as soon as they came out of the oven, and it was no trouble at all.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because they were still hot and soft or because it was a different type of pan, but I&#39;ll transfer them immediately from now on.  GREAT RECIPE!",5

I do, however have a couple tips to the people who claim the pie was too runny or eggy. When mixing the cheese filling, make sure you beat it smooth as the instructions say. It may take quite a bit of doing, considering you are dealing with cream cheese, especially if it isnt softened completely. Make sure there are no chunks left and that it is nice and whipped. The same goes for the caramel topping. I also only used 2 and a half eggs instead of 3 in the topping mixture. let the pecans swim, but dont drown them. I didnt completely use the entire topping mixture on mine. Finally, make sure your cheesecake is completely baked to the middle, and make sure you cool and refridge the pie for the proper amount of time.",5

Next time I will make sure I have walnuts because I&#39;m sure it will be even better.    I read the reviews and decided to use only 1 cup of sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.   This is now my go to banana bread recipe.  Very fast and easy.,5

1,0,0,0,100,"This was a big hit. I made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe.  First of all my daughters do not care for green chilies, so I used only one can. I also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic. My daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture.  Secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro, I use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups; so in this case I doubled the amount of cilantro. Additionally I added a quarter cup of rice. My oldest doesn&#39;t like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice I used a 48 ounce box of broth. This gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved. I used precooked roasted chicken so I added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34;.  Lastly to make it healthier I swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. All of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter.",5

0,0,1,0,193,Everyone loved them...AMAZING,5
1,0,1,0,193,"Pretty good! I doubled it and added chopped onion, because a soup without onion seemed weird, and extra cheese. I also added some freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses, Lawry&#39;s garlic salt and Tony Chachere&#39;s creole seasoning instead of the hot sauce. I omitted the salt and pepper from the roux and added to taste after I combined the cheese sauce to the vegetables. I would&#39;ve gave it 2.5 to a 3 without my tweaks.

I saw some of the comments about the jello being too runny- I used fresh strawberries macerated in sugar.  I poured them into the jello and let the jello strawberry mixture set for over an hour in the fridge -  I then poured it over the cream cheese mixture.  It was still pretty runny but set up really nice in the fridge.,5

It took 1 hour and 15 mins to bake on 350 for an hour then 375 for 15 mins. The flavor was delicious og the gravy i added some garlic in it an my potatoes were perfect but my chops were dry tasting. My grandma used to bake her chops with potatoes and i was craving it but this is definently not my grandmas way of making it her chops were very juicy and delicious and the gravy was more liquid like but she is passed so the recipe is still a mystery ??but this helped curbed that craving.

20,0,0,0,100,"I served this for 4th of July yesterday. I thought I&#39;d like it better than I did. It made a lot, which was a plus, but it was really missing something in the flavor. I found it unappealing and wished I&#39;d  served something else. Inhad 12 people for dinner; people ate it-- I had half a bowl left over. My husband said it was okay, and that he liked it well enough, but I didn&#39;t notice anyone really excited about it. Too bad. It sounded like something I&#39;d like.Perhaps I&#39;d like it with a different dressing. I think the dressing was a deal breaker for me. Maybe I&#39;ll try it again but use a favorite coleslaw dressing on it instead. Also, I wasn&#39;t crazy about the chestnuts. If I do it again, I&#39;ll use chopped jicama instead.",2
1,0,0,0,100,I stumbled upon this recipe and made it because I needed to cook a cauliflower.  This soup is absolutely Delicious!!!!!! So easy to make and all of the ingredients are staples in my pantry. I will be making this again and again!!!,5
1,0,0,0,100,These were really really good but won&#39;t make them again..they were too messy and not real easy to deal with while trying to put them together...sure was worth a try though!!!!,5
1,0,0,0,100,This was very good. I made this during the holidays and there wasn&#39;t any left. It was a great alternative to just plain corn.,5

1,0,1,0,193,"I used half the sugar so it wasn&#39;t overly sweet for me, but it&#39;s corn meal / white flour ratio is off I think.  It tasted more like a yellow cake than corn bread to me.  Not great as a corn bread.",2
1,0,0,0,100,Delicious! Better than I expected!,5
1,0,2,2,167,"This is hands down one of the most delicious things I&#39;ve ever made!  It is a little putzy, but it&#39;s not difficult by any means.  I couldn&#39;t find regular caramels, so I used caramel bits and didn&#39;t have any difficulty with oozing like others have commented.  The only bad thing is that trying to cut the candy is like trying to cut a brick with a pair of scissors.....  Also, if the candy gets too soft, despite how hard it is to cut, the top layer with come off, so I&#39;d place it back in the fridge halfway through cutting and then cut again.  Despite the effort, I&#39;ll definitely be making this again.",5
1,0,6,0,374,"Not fair to rate a recipe lower because it sounds good but you haven’t tried it. Don’t rate it until you try it!  And  for heavens sake, don’t change an ingredient  ie quick oatmeal to old fashioned and blame the recipe if your cookies are dry.  Old fashioned does make a drier chewier cookie as it soaks up more moisture from the eggs and butter. The oats are uncut and uncooked!! I always substitute while oats but  then it isn’t the same recipe is it",5

1,0,0,0,100,This may not have been the quickest soup to throw together but it was well worth it. I can&#39;t wait to make it again. I used 1 T. each fresh parsley and basil and I used the whole pound of hamburger which was the right amount compared to the amount of potatoes.,5
1,0,0,0,100,Very easy and very delicious!! This is a keeper folks!!  Next time may add some mushrooms and red bell pepper to bulk it up a little...but don&#39;t *have* to.,5
1,0,1,0,193,Made for dinner tonight. My family loved it! Voted by my kids as a recipe to add to my personal recipe collection. Very easy to make. We skipped the overnight step and mixed this recipe up and cooked it immediately. Turned out so amazing! Looking forward to making again!,5
1,0,0,0,100,"My son found this recipe and when I tried it he loved it, my husband is a diabetic and I used the Splenda brown sugar when I made it when he was home and it tasted just as good as with the regular brown sugar",5

1,0,1,0,193,"Yummy!  Cut the corn tortillas in half and place the cut sides to the edges of the dish and then fill the center with one cut half.  As others have suggested, I also heat the refried beans and mix in with the meat mixture.  Because my DH requires a low sodium diet, I use my own taco seasoning recipe, salt free canned tomatoes or my own canned tomatoes and add chopped jalepeno pepper.  This is one of my best potluck recipes.",5

1,0,0,1,100,This is my go-to coleslaw recipe. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I always add some cider vinegar to perfect the dressing.,4
1,0,0,0,100,"First attempt at these today a success and I’m no baker!  Followed recipe to a T but did sift the flour and dry ingredients together as my ginger and cloves were kinda old. Note: when it says softened butter, I DID NOT microwave the butter. It was just room temp so took awhile before it appeared light and fluffy. In fact I was skeptical about it! Took awhile to achieve light texture and was definitely not fluffy. Proceeded on with the room temperature egg, etc. I did use the hand mixer for adding in the first 1-1/2 cups of the flour mixture but then switched to stirring. Then I made all the balls up. Then I got out a little bowl and put 1/4 cup sugar in as a guesstimate. I rolled the balls in that. It was more than enough. I baked mine 10.5 minutes in a gas oven. Took them out as the cookies cracked and puffed up. They are just perfect. Outside is firm but inside is soft. Best ginger cookie recipe ever!! Hope they will stay soft.",5

1,0,0,0,100,This is an amazingly moist cake.  And the icing is the easiest icing I&#39;ve ever worked with.  I did sub the sour cream for cream cheese but it turned out phenomenal.  Definitely the ultimate chocolate cake.,5
1,0,0,0,100,Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!!  I had never made a pumpkin bread before and this was absolutely wonderful!!  It is very moist and delicious.  I put in the walnuts &amp; raisins and cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still sweet enough.  Even my husband ( who doesn&#39;t usually like ANYTHING pumpkin) really liked this!,5
1,0,0,0,100,"After reading the reviews, I really thought that when the dish cooked and then set, it would cut more like a lasagna. When plated, it fell apart. It was tasty and was received well enough from my family, but nothing very memorable. I appreciated the ease of the recipe and would make again though.",0
1,0,0,0,100,I made this cake the other night. Takes a little time but the results are fabulous! The finished product taste kinda like a fudge brownie! Yummy!,5

1,1,3,1,638,"I am asked to make these all the time...they are simple to make, not very many ingredients, and everyone seems to like them.  The only problem I have is that the glaze seems to run...any suggestions (an no, I am not using too much milk).",0
1,0,1,9,108,My wife and I made this just by the recipe and it was nasty. Thought we had made a mistake so we did it again. This is the worse tasting meat loafs I have ever tasted. I&#39;ll never make it again.,2

1,3,4,61,110,"I made this recipe today and I would have to say it’s nothing great. I did not add the potatoes and celery as these are not things I would typically expect in a “cheeseburger soup”, however I did add the carrots as it is nice to have some veggies in there. I also added macaroni so it wasn’t just liquid cheese I was eating. I guess I just hate American cheese, it’s very fake tasting and leaves a sticky coating in your mouth. I am going to try this recipe again with real cheddar and hopefully it comes out tastier.",2
1,0,0,0,100,"I wish I could show you a picture of how beautiful these came out!  Followed the recipe exactly using large eggs, not XL, and decided to just do an even dozen. They baked for 24 minutes at 325?F. They smell amazing and taste is so good!",5

1,0,0,0,100,"I added extra chicken, and did not do the pepper as I wasn&#39;t sure if my kids would like it.  I pureed 1 can of the white beans and added a large can of kidney beans.  It would&#39;ve been good to put a can of black beans, too.  This dish has plenty of protein, gluten free.  You can use plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and it tastes better with raw cheddar cheese.  Last thing I did was not put it on low for 3 hrs, rather I put my crockpot on high.  It made the chicken very tender.",5
1,0,0,0,100,Delicious! I left out the dressing because I didn&#39;t have any. I took this to a ladies&#39; dinner at church and didn&#39;t bring home a single bite! Everyone raved about it!

Great flavor, big hit with the husband!  Will make again with rotisserie chicken and replace the whipping cream and sour cream with cream cheese.  Unless a thinner chili is preferred, use the flour as other reviews suggest.",5

It was very exciting and pleased all who tried it.,5

1,1,2,13,116,Unmitigated disaster!!!!!!!!  Followed this recipe to the letter.  The potatoes were still hard and the sauce curdly and soupy.   I put it back in the oven and it took nearly another hour for the potatoes to soften. I had to finish the serving in the microwave.   The sauce just did not hold up.  I have no idea why... but I am going with a different ratio of ingredients next time,2

1,0,1,1,142,"Delicious and I like how this recipe can be customized to satisfy your own unique tastes. To the meat mixture I added corn, chopped green olives, and a couple teaspoons of lime juice.  Lots of extra cheese on the layers! Top it all off with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, jalapenos, corn chips, avocados. ..to name just a few. To those who commented that the refried beans are too hard to spread: heat the refried beans in the microwave first and the consistency will soften for easier spreading. Make sure you cover the dish before baking so it doesn&#39;t dry out or get too crispy. Enjoy",5

I thought I had made too much - instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left!  My only complaint is that I found it to be just a little bland.  (The recipe calls for no additional spices...which I thought was sort of odd.)  I browned the hash browns (which takes forever, good lord), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  (I made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before I left for work - this also turned out quite well!)  The second time I made it (tonight), I added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture.  I also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and I love to the eggs and into the whole mixture.  (Just a few dribbles.)  I basically added blindly.  It turned out SO WELL.  Just gave it enough heat to be interesting, but not overpowering.  My hot sauce is not for the faint of heart...so if you&#39;re using something less insane like Frank&#39;s or Sriracha, you made need more.  Additionally, my Swiss cheese bag was 1 1/2 cups...I figured extra cheese makes everyone happier, and I just added all of it. :D I think there&#39;s a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy.

1,0,0,0,100,"Meesh233-I haven&#39;t made this yet, but just a couple of thoughts. Are you using butter with your crumbs-most margarines today contain water which could be causing the soggy problem. Also, you are leaving the foil loose, right so that cooking is aided, but steam escapes? I&#39;m going to try dipping the breast halves in skim milk and then in panko crumbs to see how that turns out. (Panko crumbs are coarser, crisper bread crumbs that allow you to bake things with a crispy coating without frying. It is a newer product here in the US)",0

1,0,0,0,100,This is now my go-to banana muffin recipe.  I sometimes add 1C of blueberries or 1C diced strawberries.  I always add about 1/2C chopped walnuts or pecans.  I make 18 instead of 12 muffins because of the additions and I found the original recipe to be just too much for only 12 muffins.  Everybody loves these muffins.  YEEEAAA!!!,5
1,0,3,0,297,This recipe is SOOOO good!  I make it all the time for potluck breakfasts &amp; brunches!,5
1,0,0,0,100,This is basically the old Texas sheet cake (baked in a bundt pan instead of the cookie sheet) and it can be made using cola (like Coke or Pepsi) or Dr Pepper.  It can also be make using water.  I know the beer will give the cake a malty flavor but the water or soda will work too.,5

1,0,0,0,100,"These pancakes truly were light, fluffy, and delicious. I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1 tsp vanilla to the wet ingredients. My family loves vanilla flavored pancakes. I also dropped fresh blueberries onto each pancake while the first side was cooking. I had a bit of trouble combining the melted shortening with the milk and egg. Ultimately, I heated the milk and shortening together in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then whisked them together vigorously while adding the egg. Not sure if that&#39;s the best technique, but I was pleased with the product.",5
1,0,6,0,374,I really enjoyed this recipe. I read the comments prior to making and I added more garlic and seasoning (did not add extra salt or soy sauce) and I thought it was quite delicious!

1,0,0,0,100,"Great dish.  I made a few personal changes (used ground turkey, full taco pack, whole wheat tortillas) but still wonderful.  My husband loved it.  I also used the meat mixture for tacos one night, and used the remainder to make a smaller casserole for another evening.",5

I don&#39;t let it cool too much, because we think it tastes best when it is hot.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"The very best! I used 1 1/2 # ground beef and 1/2 # sausage. Also added 1/2 c water and used 1/2 t garlic powder instead of cloves (not a garlic fan).  No changes necessary...just my taste. My dinner guests agreed it&#39;s the best ever!!! Once cut, it stays in layers nicely, too.",5

I have made a few adjustments, I add only 1 can of tomatoes, also I add garlic salt and Mrs Dash Spicey seasoning (2 tsps each) to the mixture when I add the oregano.  I also add a little paprika to the cream if mushroom sauce before I spread the soup over the casserole.  I feel this adds enough extra spice to give it alot of taste.

1,0,0,0,100,Amazing banana bread.  Although I do replace half the white sugar with brown sugar and I omit the nuts and orange glaze.,5
1,0,1,0,193,My family really enjoyed this. I made it in a 9x13 pan because I didn&#39;t have the right size.  So it came out cakey but was fine. Stored in the fridge. Tasted better cold to me. And made it a bit more dense. Not as light and cakey,5
1,0,0,0,100,Excellent soup! We served it to ten and not one complaint. Definitely worth making again.,5
1,0,0,0,100,Always make this when serving chili.Thanks for sharing.,5
1,0,0,0,100,I have been GF for years and this recipe is the BEST!!!! I have made so many banana bread recipes and none of them tasted &#34;normal&#34;.  This recipe is SO SO good!I too used 2 1/2 cups of flour and I did not use the oil.ENJOY!!!!!SOOOOO good! :),5
1,0,0,1,100,I took this in for a work luncheon and everyone really enjoyed it. I did use half ricotta and half cottage cheese for the cheese blend. I always make that combo when making lasagna. It’s something my mom always did growing up and I feel makes a big different with the flavor,5
1,0,3,0,297,Awesome recipe! Super good!.....for those who have crunchy rice....uniform meatball size (try using a cookie scoop) and/or forgetting the water are your likely culprits.  This will work very well every time as written.,5

1,0,0,0,100,Very good.  I make it for family dinners.,5

1,0,0,0,100,"Absolutely delicious. I didn&#39;t have enough chicken broth, which is unusual for my house, so I used beef broth instead and it was delicious. My son who usually complains if I put celery in anything ate 2 big bowls and didn&#39;t even notice (I diced it very small). Thank you for sharing!!!",5
1,0,0,0,100,Seriously the best banana bread I&#39;ve ever made or had!  Recipe as-is is wonderful.  I&#39;ve added 1/2 cup of Reese&#39;s peanut butter chips to the batter and it is absolutely crazy good!! I also divide mine into smaller pans and adjust cooking time and temperatures.,5

1,0,0,0,100,My family REALLY enjoyed this dessert.  The cake was so moist and the frosting was delicious!

10,0,0,0,100,This is a wonderful recipe and we have made it several times but as one meatloaf instead of the little ones.  We alternate with the topping from this recipe and just putting a can of green chili&#39;s on top.  Excellent!,0
1,0,2,0,253,This is how mom used to make pot pie. Always great.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"Fantastic!  My husband loves spicy foods, but the kids and I do not.  So I compromised and used half the called-for amounts of both the green chiles and the cayenne.  The result was a dish that was a hit across the board!  After the first bite, all were requesting that this become a regular on our family dinner table.",5
10,0,6,4,240,"Ive made this numerous times with 4% cottage cheese and even 2% and it still tasted both great! My father in law and husband who are not fans of cottage cheese LOVED it and wouldn&#39;t have even known there was cottage cheese in there.  I have also used part skim cheese and it didn&#39;t make a significant difference just to make recipe lighter. I had a bag of potatoes to use up one time and chopped them into chunks and boiled them, drained, and used the recipe as is and they were delicious if you are looking to not use the frozen bag ones.Both ways are phenomenal but the skim substitutes makes per serving a bit lighter for those who are not looking for those who are watching their waist line =) excellent recipe and is a go to when I have a huge brunch and family visiting in town!",5

1,0,0,0,100,"Had last night for dinner and it was excellent. We are trying to go low carb and this looked great.   I made sure the zucchini was well drained and I baked it 25 minutes and the crust was fine. I did leave out the cheddar cheese and added more Parmesan. I also used turkey Italian sausage for more flavor and we don&#39;t eat much beef.  Topped with it with regular jar spaghetti sauce since that is all I had and yellow peppers, onion, some garlic.   So yummy!",5
1,0,1,0,193,I never thought this would work.. honestly. I thought it would be too mushy and &#34;weird&#34;. I was SO wrong and I&#39;m so glad I tried it. The peachy-cake mixture cooked up nicely and the sweet topping made the dish just creamy enough. I made my own whipped cream using coconut milk to serve and it was truly one of my favorite desserts. I will be making this very often!,5
1,0,0,0,100,OK Easy to make. Not a strong flavor. Bacon was a nice change from sausage but maybe could use some vegetable .,4
1,0,1,1,142,"I made this for a neighborhood get-together, and it was a big hit. I will definitely make it again!  I had 8 tortillas, so I made a third layer. I also had ground Elk, and used it instead of beef. It has very little fat. I used 2 cups of cheese. Thanks for sharing.",5
1,0,0,0,100,I have been making this for a long time. We love it. I believe I first got it from the comfort food diet cookbook. I put everything in it but the hot sauce. We don&#39;t think we need it. I have made this for several occasions and our friends love it also.,5

However, for my own gluttonous and rather bruttish tastes (giggle) I wanted them a little sweeter and a bit more moist (this would probably mean adding some fat like condensed milk). They ARE delicious, though. I&#39;ll make them again and I probably won&#39;t change a thing since it was so easy and it saves adding more fat. Thank you!",0

I&#39;d used 1 lb. ground beef, 3/4 cup SLICED carrots, 4 cups potatoes, peeled and cut in chunks, rather than cubed.  I used 1-1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, 1-1/2 cups milk or half and half cream &amp; used 1/4 cup Ranch dressing instead of sour cream. I found that the adjustments worked out for me!  Perhaps, dicing the potatoes IS better-I&#39;d chunked them, instead! At any rate, I really liked this recipe! If I don&#39;t have basil available, I&#39;ve used Italian seasoning instead! I really enjoy the blend of Italian seasoning anyway and have turned to it when I season dishes calling for oregano or basil!DELowenstein",5

I also topped some with raw sugar and the rest I sprinkled on large sugar crystals that i use to top cookies.  I liked the &#34;crunch&#34; that the sugar gave to the muffins.  Muffins do take the full baking time and then I baked a couple of minutes more.  I got 18 muffins from the recipe.,5

Boy was I surprised at how this recipe tasted. So was everyone else that tried it. I did not make two loaves as the recipe stated. I thought the loaves would be to small so I poured mixture into one pan. I was concerned because it was very runny(unlike traditional flour mixture). It did take longer to cook but it was perfect.

First, I cooked this in my crockpot on low for 7-8 hours….browning the meat first with the taco seasoning which I doubled for more flavor. I also used beef broth instead of water. I added another can of diced tomatoes in addition to the stewed and also added in a 4oz can of sliced black olives. At the end of cooking, I added in 4oz of cream cheese to make the soup a creamier version. Served it with some cheese sprinkled on top, tortilla chips and sour cream. My whole family loved it!

Served this at a late night Christmas eve gathering and the whole thing was polished off in minutes ! And everyone raved about how good it was.

Next time I’ll use 1/4 tsp if any at all.  I also made it in a 10x13 baking dish (instead of two round pies) which worked very well.  Would definitely recommend - just use less thyme.  ??,4

There is a slight change in flavor, it is has a little less yeast smell, but not anything to change my mind.

The other pot of soup was for vegetarians, so it was meatless; I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and, for variety, butternut squash ravioli in place of the tortellini.  What was leftover went for  lunch today so it was very good also.",5

I cut the sugar down to half a cup and substituted with coconut sugar. My oil choice was coconut oil. I added a cup of frozen blueberries too. When in the muffin tray before baking I topped them with pepita seeds.  So good, will make these again.",5

1,0,1,1,142,"This was a really good slaw but like some other reviewers noted, it did need a bit of vinegar. I added 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar and the flavor elevated. At first I thought it was a lot of mayo and sour cream for only one package of slaw mix but it was the right amount. Before you combine the dressing and slaw, taste to adjust flavor to your tastes. I also added black pepper, just because I like pepper! As a Volunteer Field Editor I recommend this recipe.",4

I let the loaves rise beside my crock pot while it was cooking some soup on low and that seemed to do the trick. The taste was really lovely, just a hint of sweet and not too yeasty, with a nice crumb and golden crispy crust. Will be making this bread often!",5
1,0,0,0,100,Very flavorful dish for such a simple recipe. I made as directed. I used a smaller baking dish so that this fish touched each other without overlapping. I wanted the sauce to completely cover the fish . So easy!  Definitely will make again. Thank you for sharing the recipe.,5

1,0,2,0,253,excellent fast recipe....husband really likes it and it makes a perfect batch for 2 people,5
1,0,2,0,253,"I am a young senior and a well seasoned cook and baker - pun intended! I know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when I say I haven&#39;t made this exact recipe, but is is very close to one my mother, who was a fabulous cook, taught me years ago. I read a lot of the reviews, because there are so many, and I want to make comments based on what I read and my level of experience.  Because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe I would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments. If you&#39;re not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon - then sample it. Not enough, add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again. If you like that amount you don&#39;t need to add the full teaspoon. Flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients. Spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything. You will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences. AND - it does not mean the recipe is not great. The person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning - based on her family&#39;s taste buds but it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be adjusted to your own! The same goes for any other recipe. Have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go. Personalize to your heart&#39;s content! It really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they don&#39;t know how to make it more palatable. I do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had Home Economics classes in high school - though they didn&#39;t teach me much I hadn&#39;t learned at home. Cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues. Remember - add a pinch or so, sample and add more till it is to your taste. Baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent (as an example) to other dry ingredients and liquids used. Again, flavouring is a very personal matter. I would like to thank Karen Johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch, with no condensed soup and artificial flavours! To quote from a book called Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, I read in my early 20&#39;s &#34;Knowledge is communicable, wisdom is not.&#34; One of my Mom&#39;s favourites: &#34; We get too soon old and too late smart!&#34;",5

1,0,0,0,100,"I followed the directions perfectly and had a blob of sticky dough. I added more flour after turning out onto wax paper because of the lack of work area I have, had to use the stovetop.

1,2,30,32,674,"southern dumplings are not made with egg, carrots, or celery.  I just use chicken, and chicken broth, salt, pepper, butter. For dumplings I use self-rising flour, small amount of shortening (about the size of a small egg) and water. mix this up till stiff.  Cut in strips or pinch off,) I pinch mine, then Add to boiling broth.  You can continue to add them even when they cover the top. Just take a spoon and put them down, keep adding as long as you can or want to. you will have to make more than one batch of dough.  I usually make 3 batches and use a 6Qt pot. But be careful, they will boil over.  When you are done adding dough, turn heat down, and continue to cook until they are shiny.  Then they are done.  If you want them like a biscuit inside, make bigger pieces to drop in. When you get enough dough, it will thicken itself. I you get it to thick, and more broth, or water.  Serve with Cornbread",0
1,0,0,0,100,This is an amazing fajita recipe! We had them last night &amp; my whole family LOVED them! I made the recipe exact (including red pepper flakes) except I did allow the chicken to marinate over night. My family used to love the Applebee&#39;s sizzling fajita skillet &amp; they took it off the menu...I tried a couple copy cat recipes &amp; none were that close. THIS is almost exactly like it &amp; my son asked how I got the recipe from them! I will be making this very often &amp; am so glad this popped up in Pinterest for me!,5
1,0,1,0,193,"Yummy! First batch went so fast, I had to make another, immediately. Both times, I just realized,  I failed to bake the crust, and it obviously turned out great anyway. The 2nd time, I wanted more custardy filling, so added 1/4 cup milk., too.  We had a house-full of people, so it makes enough. I will be bringing this to pot-lucks, for sure.  It certainly was NOT bland.  We used freshly picked rhubarb. We all loved the shortbread crust. I feel this was an easy recipe and quick, but then, I had my rhubarb already cut and didn&#39;t bake the crust before adding the filling. It tastes more custardy when eaten warm. It sets up a bit when chilled. It would be yummy even without the topping, I am sure. A big hit, here!",5

The only difference I can see is the Betty Crocker recipe called for shortening or lard rather than canola oil.

I&#39;m going to give this 375 a go this time and stick to the recipe as written.

1,0,0,0,100,"So pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It was better than I expected. I initially thought the ingredients did not allow for enough &#39;sauce&#39; but it is so flavorful and it was indeed enough. I did, however, deglaze the pan after cooking the pork with about 1/4 cup of chicken stock because the spices got concentrated on the bottom of the pan. That didn&#39;t create more &#39;sauce&#39; because it evaporated - just wanted to get the good bits off the bottom of the pan. But that  I used leftover pork roast (cubed up) instead of ground pork. I also used more liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce and added another tablespoon (it needed more of that ingredient in my mind). Next time I make it I will probably use 2 oz. of the noodles instead of 4 (just personal preference - I would like more cabbage ratio than noodle). I did add one egg towards the end and scrambled it in the pan - didn&#39;t need it necessarily but I liked the added richness it provided. I added some chopped cilantro on top as I served it.

I used Vienna bread and it was fine. My revisions for next time: leave the crusts on (that was time-consuming) and I may layer the top of the bread with thinner slices of cream cheese rather than the 1&#34; cubes. Not everyone around my breakfast table was a big fan of cream cheese chunks. I also thought that I might try using raspberries rather than blueberries to see how that goes.

1,0,4,5,185,"What a fabulous meal! I used a smidge of Smart Balance/Amish butter instead of Canola over chicken thighs. I didn&#39;t have Lemon Pepper so squeezed fresh lemon (after rolling it to release the juices) on both sides after browning. Then crisped the thick cut bacon. This is actually easier if you use scissors and cut the bacon in 1-2&#34; pc., cooks quicker also...In a separate cast iron pan, I carmelized 3 small onions in butter and spooned some of the bacon greases into it as needed. Fresh Sharp White Cheddar worked for me as well.I chopped Romaine/Buttercrunch lettuces and rough cut a few Craizines (cranberry raisins) w/coarse pepper, alternating the various delectable pieces with lettuce was almost like Wilted lettuce but better!Brava! I am seriously impressed.",4

1,0,16,1,867,"First of all, I have been making this cake for years. It is an all time favorite of mine

Next, there are a few speedboats you hit while making. For example, the batter is VERY thick. Honestly, it&#39;s more the consistency of cookie dough. Dont try to use a hand mixer on this, it will break (been there, done that). The reason for that, though, is all the liquid that is in the apples will cook out and mix with the batter while baking. It&#39;s supposed to be like that.

Next, it is VERY sweet if you use anything other than a tart apple; I always go straight for the big granny smiths. Anything else just adds together to make a sugary overload.

Last, the end result is a very moist, very heavy cake. Best if eaten quickly, even better if warm. It will not last more than a couple of days!

Pairs beautifully with some vanilla ice-cream, cinnamon, and caramel (never actually used the butterscotch sauce part of the recipe, never felt it was the right kind of flavor). Makes for a fantastic breakfast or dessert, and it&#39;s perfect for those cool autumn nights and brisk winter mornings.",4

I used sugar-free pudding and chocolate chips, splenda to replace white sugar, splenda brown sugar blend (3/8 cup), and old fashioned oats (because that&#39;s what I had). They were a little drier than other cookies I have made, but they did hold together just fine. I was surprised mine did not flatten out but looked like haystacks when baked. 2nd batch I flattened before baking. They tasted fine either way, and I will make these again.

1,0,0,5,100,Here&#39;s another one that I followed the directions right down to the letter. First of all it was to &#39;Eggy&#34; for me. So I&#39;d strongly suggest that you NOT use a dozen of eggs that this calls for! That&#39;s just WAY to much egg. The ladys at Church liked it but I can&#39;t believe this is a Grand prize winner. I won&#39;t be making this again. I was so disappointed! One lady at Church had to actually spit it out of her mouth. She said sorry but there&#39;s way to many textures going on with this. I did really like the homemade blueberry syrup however. I would rank the Syrup Only a 5 but not the casserole. I find it surprising that So many of ya&#39;ll like this so well.,2

I wouldn&#39;t make this cake without adjusting for altitude as it is so tender that it would cave in if it weren&#39;t adjusted. I removed a 1/4 of the butter and 1/4 of the sugar. It turned out great.   Other than that, it is very tasty.  It will be my &#34;go to&#34; chocolate cake recipe.Oh, I&#39;m not a fan of sour cream. I used the sour cream  in the cake with very good results--but I didn&#39;t use the frosting recipe though, as I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like it.

I added fresh sliced mushrooms, red bellpeppers, and even the long green chile peppers seeded and diced small. I made fresh salsa with Cilantro and served it on the side.

OR perhaps mix it into the batter?</p><p>- I misread the instructions, and melted butter for the crust, but then (Stupidly) measured out 6 tbsps of the melted stuff and only put that in. The crust was definitely drier than I would&#39;ve liked, it, so don&#39;t make the same mistake as me.

I made it in a 9&#34;X13&#34; glass dish. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. I did NOT add any extra sugar. I really like the filling so I doubled the cream cheese. Basically,  I make the crust than I mix the jello topping and while it&#39;s in the fridge,  I make the filling.  I folded in the whip cream instead of mixing it all together. That takes about 20 minutes or so. Then, I poured the jello topping on top and put back  in the fridge and it turned out perfect. IF you follow the directions, everything should fit nicely.  However,  since I added the extra cream cheese,  the topping was overflowing. I just poured in what fit and it was perfect!!! Ive read that people using fresh strawberries add extra sugar to them but I didn&#39;t and it doesn&#39;t need any...but that&#39;s up to you. As for the extra jello that wouldn&#39;t fit, I just put it in a seperate bowl,  and after it was set up, added some whipped cream and had that as an extra dessert!!! Everyone loves this dessert...I will make it for everything!!",5
1,0,24,1,907,This was very good. Both my daughter and husband loved it. I did use regular lime gelatin because I couldn&#39;t find sugar free and I used regular whipped topping. Very easy to make.,5

1,0,7,2,303,This is very similar to my mother’s with a couple of small exceptions.  She added the Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and then just used ketchup to top it.  I don’t think I would miss the brown sugar.  Delicious and thank you for sharing your version!,0

1,0,3,2,203,My pancake aficionado kids loved this recipe and said no more regular pancakes.   I added a small scoop of applesauce after reading all the reviews that talked about such thick batter.  My batter wasn&#39;t thick at all but I also didn&#39;t have whole wheat flour and just used all regular gluten free flour.  That might have affected the thickness as well.  Plus I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and topped them with blueberries and raspberries. These were really wonderful.  Not as heavy as I thought people said in other reviews but definitely filling.  Really great recipe and definitely a family pleaser.,5

A few notes- I wasn&#39;t too crazy about the sauce, found it to be quite bland and needing to triple the seasoning. It was also way too thick and clumpy. I ended up adding water to thin it out. I also added a bit of brown sugar to cut the salt and acidity. Next time I would half the amount of salt. On its own it was WAY too salty. Thankfully the toppings masked the saltiness. This also makes a huge batch of sauce. I have enough to last me 3 more occasions.",4

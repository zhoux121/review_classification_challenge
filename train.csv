1,0,0,0,100,"As soon as I saw this on the cover of the magazine, I knew I was going to try this.  My whole family loved it.  It is also very easy to make.  I have made it several times.  Always make as written.",5
1,0,0,0,100,This recipe is great! I have never made bread before. Aside from quick breads like banana and zucchini. Its was easy and tastes AMAZING. Suzanne I don&#39;t see any reason the old fashioned way wouldn&#39;t work. It will just be a bit more effort on your part when it comes to the incorporating.,5
10,0,5,2,261,"@Sarah (from Dec. 16, 2019): What the recipe doesn’t explain very well in step 3 is that you follow the jello recipe on the box for the amount of boiling water to add, but you DO NOT add the cold water according to the box, and you instead add in the thawed berries. Otherwise the jello gets too runny. That’s what I think may have happened to your dessert.",0
1,0,0,0,100,"This was absolutely delish!   My whole family loved them, even the kids.   I made it a second time as a cake.  Takes at least twice the baking time as the cupcakes.  Well worth the wait.  Just wonderful.  It is not complicated, very easy to make.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Really, really good.  Used 1/2 cup ea of butter &amp; flour as recommended.  Did not have frozen corn so substituted sauted mushrooms &amp; celery and did not use a bottom crust.  Poured a portion of it (kept remainder for another day) into an 8-1/2 x 9 dish, covered w/ one rolled out sheet of puff pastry, sprinkled w/ minced fresh parsley &amp; paprika, baked @ 375 for 70 min.  6 servings - our guests went back for seconds!  Great w/ double cheese bread &amp; spinach salad.  A keeper!",5
1,0,0,0,100,Thanks for that tip----didn&#39;t think about that-as I&#39;m sure other hadn&#39;t.,5
1,0,0,0,100,AWESOME!!!! Don&#39;t even bother trying to find a banana bread recipe better than this one! Won&#39;t happen. This is even better than mom&#39;s! (Don&#39;t tell her THAT though!),5
1,0,1,0,193,Excellent!  Made this for Christmas morning breakfast.  It was yummy!,5
1,0,0,0,100,"This is a very easy apple pie and delicious. I use orange juice if I don&#39;t have lemon . It is a good pie to make an impression, if you are a first time pie maker. The pie crust from a box is tasty. I have made this apple pie recipe a few times .",5
1,0,1,0,193,Hey Edward - go get your seeing-eye dog and have him read the recipe for you - sour cream is the last ingredient listed!  This is a great recipe - soup is wonderful!,5
1,0,1,1,142,"Such an easy recipe and very healthy. I added garlic and onions, used 2 1/2 C  chicken broth instead of water, and excluded the chicken/vegetable bouillon.",5
1,0,6,2,284,I agree with Chris. I can’t even make this recipe because there are so many ads popping up or covering things.  Very disappointing.,0
1,0,0,0,100,This chili was great!!  I will be making it again for sure.  I cooked mine in the crock pot and it was super easy.  ,5
1,0,1,0,193,"These were amazing. It was such a great way to use my brown bananas instead of making banana bread. I will say it didn&#39;t feel like a &#34;bar&#34; to me, but more like a shallow banana cake. It was a little dry to me, but I may have over baked it. The frosting  was delicious &amp; the two combined were such a great treat. I will make these again (for sure!) &amp; try to make them a little better on my end, such as not over baking. Great recipe.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Works fine with whole wheat flour.  If you&#39;re crazy about pecans, use the 2 cups, or you could get by fine with 1 and not sprinkle them on top.~ Theresa",4
1,0,2,1,193,"This was a great recipe. I think next time I make it I will definitely add more meat, spices, and soy sauce. This recipe is a keeper!",4
1,0,0,1,100,"If you do not thaw the berries, it helps the gelatin set up better and it won&#39;t be runny.  My family prefers this made with raspberries.  I add some fresh berries along with the frozen and also use unsweetened berries.  Doing it this way, we never have a runny gelatin problem or have the dessert separate.",5
40,0,10,2,767,"This recipe has everything a person with a sweet tooth probably loves - peanut butter cups, pudding, whipped topping, and oreos.  I don&#39;t usually like peanut butter in things except a sandwich but for this delectable dessert I changed my mind!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Came out perfectly . A very delicious chocolate cake , however not too happy with frosting and may put some cream cheese or something to it the next time.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"I always receive rave reviews when I make this, so it&#39;s worth the hassle. It&#39;s amazing in taste and visually stunning.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"This was an excellent recipe!! This recipe is now my husbands favorite. It was easy to make, but it did take me a little longer than 35 min. to make it. It was worth it though, because it was absolutely delicious. I  am going to make this when I have my next dinner party. This is definitely a keeper.",0
1,0,0,0,100,"I have tried many Banana Bread receipes, but this is the best tasting one yet.  Delicious!",5
80,0,4,0,329,"Fantastic flavorful chicken!  Hubby and I both loved it. I halved the marinade and made 4 boneless breasts.  I forgot to marinate it the night before, and it was still amazing.  A definite easy keeper.",5
1,0,0,0,100,As quick and easy to make as it is delicious.,5
1,0,0,0,100,This was delicious. I used only one can of chilis and used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was a hit in my family. Yum!,5
1,0,0,0,100,Great cookies! A tip: they are best after 2 or 3 days (you&#39;ll have to hide them though!),5
1,0,3,0,297,"I had doubts that this was going to turn out because the sauce ended up very thick.  It was almost like a paste, and I wasn&#39;t even able to simmer it for the whole hour because I was afraid it was going to burn.  However, the lasagna still tasted excellent even with the very thick sauce.  I think the next time, I will maybe use a can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of sauce.  Also, I would wait to add the last layer of mozzarella cheese until after you uncover it, because most of the top layer of cheese ended up on the foil when I removed it.  I also used the no-cook noodles for this, and they came out great!",5
1,0,7,0,390,Very easy! Used flour tortillas and two- 8in square pans and worked great. I fit five enchiladas in each pan perfectly and each were filled generously. 10/10 will make again.,5
1,0,23,5,827,"Made this today for a group of cowboys, to go along with chili and cornmeal muffins. It was well received! This will be my go to salad recipe from now on! I may add cubed cheddar cheese for the next time and for a more summer type salad I&#39;ll try adding sliced grapes. Oh so yummy. Thank you!",5
1,0,1,1,142,With a few minor differences this has been a favorite recipe in my home and community for a good many years.  We use only 1 can of cherry filling--I cannot imagine how wet it would be with 2 cans.  Try using an apricot pie filling for another very special treat.   Haven&#39;t made them for quite some time but we all cut them to be a generous size so the yield is not 60 out of a jelly roll size pan.farmerjoy,5
1,0,0,0,100,"I make this frequently, both for dessert and for breakfast treats. It always goes fast!",5
1,0,0,1,100,Used a regular cake mix.........turned out as a nice looking dessert and everyone loved it.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"I&#39;ve made this many times.  Used ham, bacon, &amp; hot sausage.  I always use fresh potatoes.  For the lady that said her potatoes were brown, all you need to do is soak them in water as soon as you take them out of food processor.  It is so much cheaper this way instead of buying the frozen ones and I always have potatoes on hand.",5
1,0,2,0,253,"Great recipe! Everyone loves it and it&#39;s easy to make. I&#39;ve tried the recipe using flour tortillas and with corn tortillas. Both ways are  good, but my family prefers it with the corn tortillas.",5
1,0,2,1,193,"First time I made this as written and it was a bit too sweet for my taste, so next time I omitted the sugar (Jiffy mix already contains sugar) and it was 5 stars. I have since made it as a Tex-Mex side with the addition of a can of green chilies topped with Pepper Jack cheese. I also baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes in order for it to set.

1,0,0,0,100,Easy and wonderful recipe.  Its number one in my book!!!!,5
1,0,0,0,100,Fantastic!  I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt.  Very YUMMY!  Kids love this.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"My family loved this soup! It was very filling and easy to put together. I used the frozen cubed hash brown potatoes which was a huge time saver. I too used beef broth and two cans cheddar soup since it was what I had on hand instead of velveeta.Quick, easy, and delicious!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Great recipe for a basic meatloaf. I used 2# hamburger and increased the other ingredients a little. I made 2 small loaves, and poured all of the sauce on top before I baked them. My family thought this was delicious. I&#39;ll definitely make this again.",5
1,0,0,0,100,This white chili is excellent!  I found this recipe in a Maine newspaper while on vacation many many years ago and clipped it out to take home to Virginia and try.  It was a big hit and since then we have won 1st Place in many Chili contests over the other traditional red chili&#39;s.  The men at my husbands work ask for me to make this every year when winter rolls around as a treat.  Definitely a keeper to impress the boss or anyone.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"I&#39;ve never made a pie before, and I used this Apple Pie Recipe as my first attempt and it turned out Great! YUM! :)",5
1,0,0,0,100,Delicioso!!  Awesome recipe.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"My family declared this the best chocolate cake ever!!  I used my own homemade frosting.  Sift 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 dash salt and cream with 1/4 cup Crisco or butter.  Add 1 whipped egg white.  A   great recipe - would not change a thing about the cake.",5
1,0,0,0,100,Tasty &amp; easy to make,5
1,0,0,0,100,This was great. My family loved it.,5
1,0,0,0,100,made with meat tortelli 2nd time  and was very good as well/ instead of sausage,5
1,0,0,0,100,"I treated just like a pizza and added to the top mushrooms, onions, the green pepper and turkey pepperoni.  It was great!!  I took it to a dog show and came home with an empty dish.  To make it healthy I used Turkey pepperoni and turkey sausage and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Let me get this straight you use 3 packages of mixes but only 1/2 cup of water?  That just makes a paste right, it does not seem like that is enough fluid.",0
1,0,0,0,100,"LOVED this one. Except I left out the refried beans and mexican style tomatoes. Instead I used Fire Roasted Tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and added in Salsa. Top with sour cream. This one is to die for. I plan to make this again next week!",5
1,0,0,0,100,I make something very similar to this and my crew loves it.  Only difference is I use chicken broth instead of the bouillon and no bacon.   Good stuff!,5
1,0,2,1,193,"I love this meatloaf.  Very flavorful, and the leftovers are great as well.  This one&#39;s definitely a keeper!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"We liked this a lot, and will definitely make it again!  I am always looking for new ways to use tilapia since it is so affordable and adaptable.  Was thinking of maybe browning the fish quickly on both sides next time, just to give it a more pleasing eye appeal.  Thanks to Hope Stewar for submitting the recipe.",5
1,0,2,0,253,"I made this for my sister and brother in law&#39;s birthday. He likes anything that&#39;s peanut butter and chocolate! I found it very easy to make. It was a little tricky getting the Oreos on the bottom. I think next time I would omit the butter and just sprinkle them in the pan. I used fat free cream cheese and light cool whip, still came out great! My brother in law thought it was very rich but I thought it was perfect.",5
1,0,1,0,193,"5 stars with adjustmentsThis is the only way to make lasagna - I tried making lasagna the traditional way - what a pain.I&#39;ve been using this recipe for several years.  I use cheapy Hunts spag sauce (find it for 99 cents), sm can of tom paste and 8 oz tom sauce and add seasonings and ingredients (olives, green beans, red peppers to stretch, etc as desired).  I usually make the sauce a day or two ahead.  I&#39;ve used up to 32 oz of cottage cheese and mixed with basil and seasonings and it was fine and different combinations of cheeses.  I use an oval crockpot with no problem and if I&#39;m in a rush, have cooked on high for 3 hours and it&#39;s perfect.  Sorry so long, I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t reviewed before.",5
1,0,0,0,100,The whole family loved this!  I added chicken and used whole wheat linguine.  It was very yummy!,5
1,0,0,9,100,Ok it looks white and tastes good but I don&#39;t like the inside at all I hate it nasty nasty white cake ever,2

1,0,9,4,710,Great recipe! I cooked it 10 minutes longer but other then that it was great! My fussy husband loved it!,5
1,0,0,0,100,Love this recipe. Made it a couple of times now and both times delicious. I never thought I&#39;d have banana bread again! YUM! Make sure you add Xanthan Gum to the flour mixture if you are using Bob&#39;s all purpose flour to make it light. 2 t. per cup of flour.,5
1,0,2,0,253,"Personally I thought the onions were too sweet, and the flavors didn’t really go together. On the other hand, my husband really liked it and urged me to make it again!",3

1,0,3,2,203,"This was amazing! I chose different shredded cheeses mixed mild cheddar, colby and sharp cheddar. I added about 2 TBS evaporated milk and used 1 1/2 2% milk and it was very creamy.

1,0,0,0,100,"I&#39;ve been using this recipe for years, yes, from Bon Appetite, and it never fails to get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I do use a little less sugar, 1 1/4 cups because I prefer it a little less sweet.",5
1,0,0,0,100,next time would add yoghurt in place of applesauce (normally used and gives moisture but also great taste). Prefer recipes that outline exactly what the gluten-free flour combo is.,4
1,0,0,0,100,This was a fantastic recipe.  Followed directions exactly and bread disappeared quickly.  To the reviewer who said their blueberries fell to bottom of the pan. The solution is to reserve 1 Tablespoon of your flour and put in sandwich bag then add your completely dry blueberries and coat them.  This prevents them from falling to the bottom of your pan.This is a bread you could take anywhere and be proud.  Thank you to the person who took the time to post/share with me.,5

1,0,2,0,253,"Amazing recipe! My husband and I visit this small Amish/Mennonite restaurant and I always get their Rhubarb Custard Pie. This reminds me of that pie, but so much easier to make. To cut back on calories, I omitted the frosting and just drizzled a very thin vanilla frosting over the top and I was happy with the result. This will be my go to recipe from now on, replacing the rhubarb custard pie I usually make. Thanks for sharing this.",5
1,0,0,0,100,My pie didn&#39;t set up..followed instructions to a tee....but we ate it with a spoon..great flavor!,4
1,0,0,1,100,This stuff is awesome. DO take the time to make it! It&#39;s not like eating some piece of candy from the store. It tastes homemade and way better than Snickers.

1,0,0,0,100,"I got this recipe in your 2004 Best Holiday  Recipes magazine. It is wonderful. I make it exactly by your recipe with the exception of the bake time, I bake it 1 hr 10 min. I have taken it to church many times and I get rave reviews. It&#39;s a keeper. . . .",5

1,0,0,0,100,This is a yummie recipe and very easy to make.  I think the only change I would make is to use a bit more enchilada sauce.  Black beans are good in this too!,0
1,0,0,0,100,"This is such a great recipe! We did make a few adjustments.  For the sauce to put on the apples, we halved everything except the vanilla.  For the crust/crumb mixture, we only put in 2/3 cup of brown sugar.  Next time we will try 1/2 cup as it was still plenty sweet!  My husband made it and he loved how easy it was!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"I made this cake for my husband&#39;s birthday. When I read the recipe, I was skeptical, as I had never heard of hot milk cake. I decided to try it because of all the great reviews. It was a bit more work than my usual yellow cake recipe, but it was well worth it! This is the fluffiest cake I have ever made. It was moist and light. I followed the recipe exactly. I think that beating the eggs for the full five minutes is essential. I made two 8x8 cakes and froze one for another day. I served the other one with fresh strawberries and light whipped cream. My husband raved about it. This is my new favourite cake recipe!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"I made this as a vegetarian dish, with Yves meatless ground (which is better than the frozen kind, and usually around $3 for a package that equals 1 pound of ground beef.)  Like others I also used cheddar in place of the velveeta, and since the meatless ground beef adds texture but not a lot of flavor I also added imitation bacon bits to add a little &#34;meat&#34; flavor.  It came out delicious, with a wonderful texture.  I will certainly be making this again!",5

1,0,4,4,196,Very good soup!  I did half of the recipe for my husband and I and it was the perfect amount for us to eat once with leftovers a couple of times.I left out the jalapeno peppers since we do not like spicy food.

1,0,1,0,193,Not impressed.  Not very moist or flavorful.,1
1,0,1,0,193,I followed the recipe EXACTLY  except  that I omitted the nuts.  The dough is so dry it won&#39;t hold together.  I added 2  tbsp of water.  I was expecting a much much nicer tasting and nicer looking cookie.  I went with this recipe because of a) the reviews and b) the ratio of oatmeal to flour.  Will. NEVER make them  again.  I got 6 dozen &#34;buttons&#34; about 1.5 &#34; diameter.  I see the other reviews and shake my head as to what went wrong. Maybe I should have added another egg or two but won&#39;t bother trying this recipe again.  Sorry!,1
1,0,1,5,113,Really bland. Looked super delicious in the pic. I would say skip the almond extract and use cinnamon in its place. And instead of the mixture on top us a cobbler/cake crumble instead. I think that would do the trick. Nobody in my family of 6 liked it. And I&#39;m the only one that is picky. So that&#39;s pretty bad.,1

The after taste makes me want to hurl right now. I hate throwing food in the garbage but another meal of this wasn&#39;t going to happen. I even added some fresh ground pepper to cut the sweetness. Thank the heavens for pepper. I looked forward to eating this recipe and I am very bummed about throwing $$$$ down the drain. Fellow culinary participants...Stay away from this recipe. Very sad right now. If I could give no stars I would.",1

1,0,1,0,93,"I have been making this cake for over 25 years ... it is one of my husband&#39;s favorites ... I do use salted Butter ... if you don&#39;t have salted butter just add 1/2 tsp salt ... and I use 1 TBS of Vanilla. The mixture is thin!  BUT it works perfectly. I usually make it in a Bundt Pan , just because we like it that way. Too thin for a Tube Pan ... I like to make this to add to Gift Baskets. Use 6 to 7  PINT size  wide mouth jars, Grease inside, fill about 2/3 full place on a pan to bake @ 350  about 18 mins.  or until touch test works. Place lids and rings on as soon as you can after removing from the oven, they will seal ... tighten after jars have cooled ... if sealed they will be GOOD for at 2-3 months in cabinet.

My family and guests thought it was great and finished every drop. In the past I&#39;ve added a splash of lager or pale ale to my chowder (not canon, I know, but I like it) and I may do that with this recipe in future. It just adds a little depth to the flavor.",5

I now keep rice noodles on hand just for this recipe. I also save some time by browning a full pound of ground pork ahead of time in the sesame oil, separating it into two 1/2-pound packages and freezing it (just remember to label the package so as to not confuse it for browned ground beef). This dish goes together so quickly with these short cut hacks and you have a delicious alternative to time-consuming conventional egg rolls. Delicious flavor!!",5

Substitutions: Instead of frozen corn I used a can of yellow/white corn which I drained, omitted the peas as my boyfriend does not care for peas, browned the hamburger with the onion &amp; garlic and used Johnny&#39;s seasoning salt on the meat. For the mashed potatoes I used a package of Idahoan Bacon with Cheese mashed potatoes adding about 1/4 c. extra water. Then right before serving I put it under the broiler to get the cheese browned.

The only thing I did differently (because of lack of exact ingredients) was to substitute pizza sauce for the tomato sauce and replaced the italian seasoning with a mixture of basil and oregano.

Topped it with more jack cheese. And, I baked it in my 9&#34; x 9&#34; ceramic dish and it was amazing.

The few changes I made: I used Sargento sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed. There was no graininess in the texture, which sometimes can happen with pre-shredded cheese. I am not an expert cook by any means, but I was a little thrown off by the milk/flour mixture. I am used to making a roux, so that is what I did instead. To the roux, I added half and half (instead of milk) and the cheese. I then poured this mixture into the pot with the veggies/broth. I didn&#39;t think this recipe needed any salt, so I didn&#39;t add any. I topped each bowl with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and some green onions. So, so, good!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Made this for dinner last night. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I wasn&#39;t blown away by it. I didn&#39;t really taste the zucchini, so it would be a good way to sneak some in on a veggie hater. Left off the green peppers &amp; topped mine with mushrooms &amp; black olives. I will probably make it again, but not often as there is a lot of cheese!",4

1,0,2,0,253,"Before I retired I frequently add this casserole for a morning treat for my coworkers and occasionally sent it with my hubby to his job! Everyone loves it even folks who cringe when you mention cottage cheese! It really does just melt right in. I usually use build pork sausage like Jimmy Dean because you can get it together without the mess of cooking up bacon! And I increase the amounts of most everything when taking to a group...exact amounts have never seemed to be too important...the outcome is always great! Like some others commenting, I’ve frequently added diced sweet peppers.   I also make a smaller version in a skillet and bake that for just us at home! Try this one, I’m sure it will become one of your faves too!",5

1,0,0,0,100,"I&#39;m totally confused by everyone who loved this recipe. I halved it because I was making one pie. I found the 1/2 cup of flour way too much for thickening. I had to thin it using additional milk and broth which threw me off. I then needed additional salt and pepper. When I realized how thick my sauce was I looked at other recipes. For the amount of liquid I used, 1/3 cup of flour is appropriate. I&#39;m certain I measured correctly. My flour was all purpose. It was fine after the adjustment.",3
10,0,0,0,100,This was very good and hubby agreed! I&#39;m making it again next week.,5
1,0,0,0,100,A total hit with my family! I adapted it for fewer servings using an 8 x 8 pan and omitted all the almond extract because I&#39;m not a fan. I added sliced almonds on top of the pie filling instead. Mine took the full bake time. Definitely making this again.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"Great recipe, best bread I’ve made so far - turned out exactly as you’d hope and has risen perfectly. Topped mine with shallots and grated cheese before baking for a bit of added flavour. Definitely recommend you try this one!",5

I did not use scallops because I didn&#39;t have any.  I live on the water and have access to fresh fish, shrimp and crabs  so that is what I used.  I also added a little garlic and some Cajun seasoning.  I doubled the sauce recipe and used a lot more cheese.  The second time I made it, it turned out better.    I will give the original recipe a three star rating and the recipe after my few changes  still just three stars.  And , No, I will not make it again.  It serms like something is missing.

Moist, homemade flavor even though it&#39;s from a box and has flavored gelatin. I was skeptical, but now throughly impressed. It was a real hit! I use a good avocado oil for baking instead of canola or veg oil. I used a food chopper to chop  strawberries. They were perfect! Not too fine and not too big. I used the frosting recipe - ingredients only but with different measurements, plus added cream cheese to it and made it as a filling between the layers ( not nearly as sweet that way, as others had mentioned), and frosted with White icing.  I tripled  this recipe and baked it in a 12 x 12 x 2 pan.  Only used about 2 1/2 of the recipes  instead of the full tripled amount to fill the pan.  It came out perfect!   I used  nonstick spray on pan as well as the parchment paper and sprayed paper. Do not let cake cool completely in pan. Only cool cake about 10-15 min on a cooling rack.  Took a knife and wen along the edges of the pan to release any possibly stuck sides. I noticed that the gelatin with the sugar may stick a little bit, but it&#39;s not bad. Then placed another piece of parchment paper on the top of the cake, placed cooling rack on top of the cake and while holding both cooling rack and pan flipped cake over and let it sit for a moment. Shook gently. Removed pan. Nothing stuck!  Just a thought, but  usually can&#39;t go wrong when a cake recipe begins with Mamaw.",5

The chopping is a chore to say the least but he likes doing putzy stuff like that. Using sliced water chestnuts would trim some of the time off. Since he made it the night before, the dressing and onions had time to mellow.Exchanges I&#39;d make in the future would be half Miracle Whip and half yogurt, trying plain and then lemon. For salad meal, I&#39;d add add cheese cubes, ham, chicken, summer sausage, that lonely hotdog and sunflower or pumpkin seeds. Maybe whole grain pasta.

Please don&#39;t chastise Shaar. We all have our preferences and I look for warnings about recipes that are too sweet because I don&#39;t like too much sweetness either.

20,0,3,0,297,"I made this recipe and made a couple very minor changes due to having certain ingredients on hand.  I used chicken broth instead of beef,  1 1/2 pounds chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces, 12 ounces of smoked beef sausage and 1 pound of 21/30 shrimp.  Everything else was as listed in recipe.  I must say, the finished dish was EXCELLENT!!  I would recommend this recipe to anyone and it would make a wonderful meal for guests.  Five stars for sure!!",5

I can not understand how some people thought the butter was in the glaze. And, I agree, I have to cook about 10 minutes longer. Could be my oven. This never disappoints and could certainly be changed up using other berries and juice.",5

After reading the reviews I made sure to dry the zucchini well, and I jazzed up my sauce with some fresh herbs (basil, parsley and oregano) and garlic, and instead of ground beef I used hot and spicy breakfast sausage I had on hand. Can&#39;t wait to make it again with a layer of sauteed mushrooms! Thanks for this great recipe.",5

I added a splash of cinnamon and they are fantastic! I cooked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes, perfect timing. I didn&#39;t fill the  muffin tin half way, so they were a bit smaller than typical muffins but they&#39;re a hit.

Still though super yummy!",5

1,0,0,0,100,Very yummy!  Doubled this and used home canned tomatoes and thawed swiss chard instead of spinach.  Next day the tortellini&#39;s started falling apart and absorbed a lot of the liquid still very tasty but better the first day.,5

10,0,0,0,100,These were a total surprise to me! When I read the ingredients it sounded like nothing I ever tried so I wanted to review it for sure. I was expecting them to be really sweet but they weren&#39;t at all. The batter was much thicker than I am used to but that was just fine. I didn&#39;t have whole wheat flour so I just used regular and I had no buttermilk so I used what I had in the fridge. The only thing I would edit about the directions for this recipe is you should have a cooking temp on there because I didn&#39;t realize that they should be cooked at a lower temp because of how thick and it seems a few others had that issue as well. If someone would like thinner pancakes they could easily just add more milk until the get the right consistency for them. Great recipe really nice job I will make it again for sure. Thanks for sharing!,4
1,0,0,0,100,I hosted a pie party and this was th pie that I baked . It was so delishous everyone was asking for the recipe . To this day my friends still request this scrumptious pie .,5

1,0,0,0,100,Very delicious! I didn&#39;t have the paprika but it turned out just fine without it. It was a little colorless which I assume was because I omitted the paprika. It did need more salt but it was still tasty as is. I will definitely make this again!,5

1,0,0,0,100,was a bit hard to tell when done i am a bit o.c.d about doneness and making sure things are cooked thoughly.  so mine was a bit over done...but still very good. i also halved the recipie and made this for me and my bf on xmas morning well i made it the day before and cooked it on the morning of xmas. love that its a make ahead deal the the syrpe that you make with the recipie is very yummy a bit bland as its just sugar and blueberries mostly but very very yummy.  i would recommend maybe cutting the cream cheese up alot smaller than i did to disperse it a bit more but other than that i loved it and he was sick but tasted it and said it was very good def will be making this again and again especial for xmas morning fantastic breakfast or brunch idea or maybe even dinner :),4

The first time I made it, my boyfriend remarked &#34;, if I ordered this at a restaurant, I would be back the very next night&#34;.  I have made this at least 30 times and it is always fantastic.  This recipe is simple enough to be quick and easy and yet involves enough flavor to make you feel like you are simply amazing in the kitchen.  I typically double the marinade.  While the chicken is marinating, I chop vegetables.  I have been adding mushrooms lately and it&#39;s a great addition.  I cook the veggies first, be sure to add salt and pepper.  Then I cook chicken after marinating for at least 1 hour.  Mix it all together and voila.  I love to cook all the time, but this recipe has to be made regularly.  It&#39;s just that good!   And don&#39;t skip the red pepper.  Cleanup is also easy, it only requires a cutting board and a pan!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Very good, but mine came out a little soupier than I expected.  The leftovers thickened up and were perfect! I served it over brown rice.  Next time I will use large or jumbo shrimp, the medium shrived up too much.",4

I did follow the tips about creaming the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and also chilled the dough for 20 minutes before scooping and baking. I&#39;m really not sure why some people had such problems with it, maybe their butter was too soft. I will say that for my family&#39;s taste, I did need to add additional spice. I added a whole extra teaspoon of the ginger and increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and honestly, I could&#39;ve done with even more, which is why after tasting the test batch I rolled them in a cinnamon sugar/pumpkin pie spice mixture.

I beat the eggs a long time until they were light and fluffy and then added the sugar and beat again until light and fluffy for quite a bit. My batter was smooth and creamy. I baked this in a glass baking dish so I reduced my oven temp to 335. When it was done and cooled I made a fresh blueberry compote to serve on top with a dollop of homemade whipped cream but refrigerated whipped topping would work just as well. I liked it because it’s a light dessert without heavy frosting to hold it down. Perfect for a light spring or summer supper.,5

I prep the entire filling ingredients and either freeze it in two parts or use a half for that evening&#39;s meal.  I&#39;ve made it with both chicken and 90%/10% ground beef and the chicken is our favorite.  We returned from visiting family for Thanksgiving and I plucked out the zip-lock bag of filling and it&#39;s in the oven right now, smelling so good.   We dollop on some sour cream and the hubster likes hot sauce for extra zing.  I have this recipe saved to my iPad home screen for quick reference.   Great creation!!",5

Pour sauce over the balls.  Cover and bake at 335-350. Check after an hour or 90 minutes. Be sure to get the porcupine balls covered in the sauce since this is what cooks the rice.

Oh and I also used dried parsley instead of fresh.  I can understand why the one reviewer said it was &#34;dry&#34;, but I don&#39;t really agree.  There isn&#39;t a traditional sauce.  But the lemon and butter definitely keep this from becoming dry.  Even the leftovers were delicious.  We will definitely make this again.",5

I have now made a total of 8 loaves and we stopped buying bread from the store. I cook it 30 mins, baste them with butter and then cook them 5 more minutes. Then I baste them again when I take them out. I didn&#39;t have canola oil so I just use vegetable and it&#39;s amazing!",5

1,0,0,0,100,I made this for Easter Brunch. It definitely deserves 5 stars!! It fed a crowd. Adults and children ate it all.  I did not have cottage cheese on hand but used Ricotta cheese which I did have on hand. It would have been a little more moist if I had used cottage cheese which I will do next time. I put it together the day before and refrigerated it overnight. Perfect. Great Recipe!! Delicious. This will be my go to breakfast casserole (to serve alongside Pillsbury&#39;s French Toast Bake Casserole and a Virginia baked ham).,5

So, like one of the reviewers, I added a couple dashes of garlic powder when browning the ground beef, which definately zips it up, plus, I added about 3-4 dashes of worcestershire sauce, and 3 shakes of cayenne pepper to the soup.

1,0,0,0,100,"Good, basic white bread. I bake a lot of fancy breads and thought I would give this a go and it came out fine. I also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves. It had a nice crust and the bread itself had a nice &#39;sopping up&#39; power with my tomato based sauce. It was a little heavier than store bought, mass produced, &#39;half-baked&#39; store bought garbage, but that is obviously to be expected. We went through both in less than 2 days. I&#39;d make it again.   For those having issues, following directions is key. Use bread flour. Be patient. Put away your bread machine. Temp your water. Let the starter work. Don&#39;t use too much flour....only what it needs. (You probably won&#39;t need all 6 cups) If this isn&#39;t taking you a good 3-4 hours to make, you&#39;re doing it wrong.",4

I didn&#39;t have peas, so substituted cut fresh asparagus for the &#39;green.&#39;  I also added garlic and bay leaves to the roux (removed before pouring into pie shell).

It was exactly like the peanut butter fudge they used to serve in the school kitchen when I was little.  Soooooo good!  At Debbie on Nov 3, 2018... The butter is used to grease the pan in step 1.  At Susan11160 on Apr 24, 2018... Maybe you should give the recipe a try before giving it such a poor rating.  The marshmallow fluff gives the fudge a soft, slightly fluffy texture and is not at all gross.  I&#39;m not fond of thick, dense, hard fudge.  This definitely is NOT thick and dense or hard... it&#39;s nice and soft and fluffy.",5

1,0,0,0,100,"This was a huge hit at my office, just as the previous reviewer said. In the recipe I usually make, it has use a slightly different ratio of flour and sugar (2 c flour and 1/2 sugar) so it&#39;s the same volume of dry ingredients but the first time I made this recipe I followed it as written. I thought it would be too sweet with double sugar I&#39;m used to tasting and three sweet, ripe bananas but it wasn&#39;t too sweet at all. In fact, the person in my office who usually is most concerned with sugar content raved about these and with good reason too because they are delicious! If you want to reduce the sugar by up to half the called for amount, they are still yummy, but just remember to compensate by adding flour equal to the reduction in sugar. Personally, I&#39;m fine with 1 c sugar. The only variations I use are to sprinkle the top of each muffin with about 1/8th tsp of raw unwashed sugar before baking  because the big crystals bake a nice caramelized sugar crunch to the muffin tops. I also preheat the oven 100 degrees higher than baking temp then when I put the muffins in, drop the temp to the correct temp. I found these indeed take the full 18 min or so even with the high preheat temp. Supposedly, the high preheat temp makes them crown higher without over baking them. As a side note, parchment paper cupcake liners work the best if you have them. Thanks for reading my long review. Again, killer recipe! I&#39;ve made it several times now with great results each time. Thank you so much for a great addition to my muffin rotation!",5

I flattened mine for more even cooking but they still took 30 minutes or more. When I figured they were taking a long time, I cooked the bacon separately, otherwise dinner would have been really late. Once the chicken was done I put some bacon grease in the chicken pan and cooked the onions. I added a bit of chicken broth to the pan to deglaze and I had a bit of a really nice gravy that was totally unexpected.I also worried that cooking everything in the order that the chicken would get cold. I agree the steps should be reversed. Cook the bacon, then onions, then chicken and I suggest adding the onions back to the pan with the chicken to warm them before serving. That way, everything is hot and the cheese will melt. This will definitely be made again in our house!",5

We topped with green onions, cheese &amp; avocado. I definitely would have added more rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilis) if I had the extra can.

And likewise with the walnuts. I only had pecans. The 1st time I tried the recipe I used an 11 cup pyrex dish as I saw that it made a really big loaf. I started to moniter the baking process at approx. 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick. This time I doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before, except I used only 3 bananas (only had that many) and baked in a 13 x 9. I also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting.

It’s neat how the syrup moves to the bottom under the cheesecake. I love that magic!  Anyway, super easy with limited ingredients and great taste.... just add a little more time.

Use a slightly larger casserole dish and do NOT use frozen anything. When the recipe states 3/4 cup - use 1 full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven. Also, the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish. We will place (lightly) a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first 30 minutes so it won&#39;t crust over too badly. PLUS, the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your family&#39;s tastes.  BUEN PROVECHO",5

We also added sour cream and guacamole as a garnish.Things I will do differently next time I make it: I will use sliced GREEN onions in beef mixture AND as a garnish. I will use a tub of fresh salsa instead of Mexican diced tomatoes, and when I do that I will delete the 2/3 cup water, because fresh salsa has way more juice than a can of diced tomatoes. And I would definitely break up the top layer of tortilla&#39;s and spread them evenly, cuz those were tough to cut. I had to perforate them with a sharp knife to get an even cut. Even sprinkled with cheese and baked they were not soft enough to cut pieces with the spatula.Other than my changes, this was an awesome first time recipe for us and we liked it!",4

I don&#39;t do all those layers and use only 2 layers of noodles (6 total). I continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later! Isn&#39;t that what all cooks do as we learn?  One thing I will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results - like shred the mozzarella (preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and DOES affect the results). Also, don&#39;t use cheap ingredients (garbage in garbage out). If you use pre-processed ingredients don&#39;t blame the recipe!!   I recently found a true Italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made!  In regards to the sauce-I have learned that weather (like humidity) actually makes a difference. I purposely make a thick sauce so the layers &#34;stay in place&#34; as I dislike runny lasagne.

1,0,0,1,100,I wish there was a higher rating then five stars. This was my. First homemade apple pie and it came out the best I&#39;ve had in my life and that&#39;s not just because I made it haha. There were a few different changes I made and that is 1. I used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container. 2. I skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking. I know it&#39;s not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust. 3. I substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor.  Also I forgot to set the timer and didn&#39;t read the cover with foil part so I accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about 45 minutes. Apples weren&#39;t mushy but also not hard . Right in the middle. I used janigolds and  Mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard.,5

I&#39;d used 1/4 cup lemon juice and1/4 cup sugar and I cooled the bread at least 20 minutes so that bread had a chance to settle!  I glazed the loaves as soon as they came out of oven.  I&#39;d probably bake the miniature  loaves 40 to 45 minutes and the 7&#34; loaves at least 45 to 50 minutes.  I used my cake tester to test the loaves and made sure that the cake tester came out clean! This recipe is a good one!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  delowenstein",5
1,0,1,0,193,I thought this was good.  I added about a half of a vidallia onion finely chopped to the dutch oven with a couple of Tbls. of butter and let that cook for a few minutes before adding the rest of the veggies.  I let the veggies cook for a few more minutes tossing them together and adding salt and pepper before adding chicken broth (21/2 cups instead of water and omitting the boullion).  I then made the cheese sauce adding fresh nutmeg and then added the cheese sauce to the vegetables.  I did not add the hot sauce .,4

Although I liked the flavor, in the first batch the filling was too &#39;soupy&#39; for my taste. Also, the flour tortillas became soggy. In the second batch I eliminated the salsa, and used just enough hot sauce to flavor and moisten. I also used corn tortillas, which is what I am used to with enchiladas. I used about half of the can of chilies.I always put a small amount of cream cheese in my enchiladas, - it adds a nice richness, and many people don&#39;t even realize it is there, although they are aware of the richer flavor. A small amount of cream cheese also enhances sandwiches, even if they have another type of cheese already!",3

I did however make a few changes do to my liking of clam chowders i&#39;ve had in the past. i added a small carrot finely diced. Instead of 1 cup water i added another bottle of clam juice since i was using fresh clams there was no juice. I also cut the bouillon down since i was using the extra juice. i also used heavy cream instead of half and half so i didn&#39;t need the flour. Sprinkled black pepper on top after it was cooked..It was a hearty thick creamy soup and i will definitely make it again. This is the second time i&#39;ve made it so i knew it needed some tweaking. I also let me veggies and clams cook longer before adding the potatoes and broth. Served with oyster crackers,,It was so yummy!",4

I did make the flour and butter into a rue; cooked for 2 minutes then added chicken broth;  cooked another 2 minutes then I added the canned soup to this mixture to heat in order to ensure no flour taste and got a real nice cream texture to add to the soup.  The only change I made was to use cream of chicken soup but mushroom would be equally nice.  This recipe is time consuming so do the prep work ahead as Virginia suggested or just be prepared that it will definitely take longer than 10 minutes to prepare.  Will definitely be making again.  Thanks Virginia.",5
20,0,0,0,100,I added some bacon drippings and made Miracle Whip part of the dressing along with the mayo and yet the flavor was still bland to me.

The loaf was good, too, though a little small. I will definitely be making these as an alternative to cupcakes. Would be good for breakfast or a midday snack if you left the frosting off.

Marinated for about 2hrs. I love cooking in cast iron and I use a counter top hot place that I can adjust the temperature to precise numbers. I used 375 degrees.

It does take some time, but most of that is from rising and baking and I can still do other tasks while that&#39;s happening, so I think it&#39;s worth it.

1,0,1,0,193,This dessert was a fluffy little piece of lime heaven!  I used regular jello and whipped topping as some other reviewers did.   This would be a perfect dessert for a summer gathering.  It just tastes like summer and is so easy!,5
1,0,0,0,100,"Loved it! However, I did what several other reviewers suggested and used corn tortillas instead. To keep the tortillas soft versus &#34;grainy&#34;, I cooked them in a little canola oil for about 15 seconds each and drained on paper towels. (I know this totally added to the calories, but we don&#39;t like the flour tortillas because they become soggy) I did use more cheese - probably closer to 2 cups (jalapeño jack and cheddar). Other than the extra cheese and corn tortillas, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I have to say that I always viewed lettuce and tomatoes on these types of casseroles as &#34;optional &amp; pretty garnish&#34;, but it is a must for this casserole! Almost tastes like a taco salad.

Taking my own cue for the traditional lasagna I typically make, the next time I made this I added some chopped onion and baby portabella mushrooms, and I used one package of ground beef plus I  added one pound of bulk Italian sausage.  Once thry were all cooked together, I  layered the ravioli  ( cheese only)  the sauce, the mozarela cheese, plus I also added a package of provolone cheese slices, divided, and I topped twitch one half a jar of Alfredo sauce.  I then repeated the ayers , endings with the red sauce and cheese, and baked as directed.  It&#39; is  a lot easier than putting the traditional lasagna recipe together.

It&#39;s really one of those things that sounds strange in your head. . Chili with chicken?  Hrm.. I dunno.  Just try it.  It makes you nervous to try it, because it seems odd, but once you try it, it&#39;s awesome!  No one in my family are huge onion people, so I always get a small onion and probably only use 3/4 of it, and I chop them up really tiny.

I&#39;ve tried other recipes, but I always return to this one for the rest of my family.  Yum!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"I made this recipe three times all summer long and these are my observations.  First and foremost, if you follow my recommendations, you will not have any problems at all, despite what others say here.  What I did is use Reynolds (brand) Release Foil (make sure dull side is facing up) in the 10X15X1 pan.  MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH FOIL HANGING OVER THE SHORT ENDS TO LIFT THE COOKIES OUT OF THE PAN LATER.  I ALSO sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray very lightly.  I made sure all of the graham crackers fit properly in the pan (trim using a paring knife if need be--it&#39;s much easier than you think).  Once the crackers are in the pan properly, I did use more than two cups of mini marshmallows...probably 2-1/2 cups total--enough to cover all of the crackers sufficiently.  Then what I did is I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of light brown (not dark brown) sugar.  Make sure you use real butter and fresh brown sugar.  I cooked it precisely 1 minute after the butter melted.  I think what a lot of cooks are doing is cooking the butter and brown sugar mixture too long.  This will cause the cookies to not turn out like they are supposed to (I know from experience).  I used 1-1/2 teaspoons of GOOD cinnamon (like Penzey&#39;s Celyon) and good, double strength vanilla extract.  I also put a PINCH (no more) of salt in the caramel mixture.  When it is cooked, I transferred the entire caramel mixture into a Pyrex measuring cup and poured it very carefully over the marshmallows so nothing puddled.  Then I topped with the coconut and almonds and baked for 12 minutes and then checked it.  My oven tends to be a bit psychotic, so it only takes about one minute more in mine to brown.  When you take the cookies out of the oven, you will see that the marshmallows look like they are not cooked all the way.  Don&#39;t worry.  They will finish melting when you take them out of the oven.  Remove pan from oven and place on a towel on table or counter for five minutes.  Then lift cookies out by short ends with the foil overhang and place back on table or counter for five minutes or so (depends on temperature in your house at the time).  Then lightly spray a large pizza cutter with nonstick spray and use the pizza cutter to slice through the cookies--don&#39;t remove from pan right away--just slice.  Then let cool completely and put in a very loosely covered container.  They won&#39;t last long enough to go stale.  Not to worry.  People are having problems with these cookies because, I think, they are cooking the caramel way too long.  Even a minute too long is tooo long.  I hope this helps you guys so that you will try it--even try it again, if you didn&#39;t like the way they turned out the first time.  Happy baking!",5
1,0,0,0,100,I just love this banana bread - which in my version is more like a cake:-) Don&#39;t like walnuts so I use pecans and then I throw in a good handful of dark chocolate chips. Yum Yum...,5

1,0,4,0,770,"This is a keeper. I couldn’t decide whether to use vegetable vs chicken bouillon so did 1tsp of each. The tsp of hot sauce is NOT optional in my opinion, it’s a must. And no, it doesn’t make it spicy at all. I also added maybe an 1/8-1/4 tsp dry mustard (to give it that background kick like in beer cheese soup), 1/4 cup diced onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic into the veggies. I used sharp cheddar for the most flavor &amp; it came out perfect. Normally I’m always adding extra salt or bouillon to most soups but didn’t need to with this one. It was plenty thick without blending any of the veggies.",5

1,0,0,0,100,I made this cake on 10/13/13. this is one of the best cake I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s very MOIST and I love it. I just change one thing and that was the ginger I added allspice instead. Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
1,0,0,0,100,I made these cupcakes due to the over abundant supply of zucchini we have in our garden and they were absolutely delicious!  I brought them to work and EVERYONE raved about them.  The carmel frosting really added that special touch. I would definitely make them again.,0

I always have bananas and have made countless different recipes but never found one I really liked until I made this one.

I would completely agree with it&#39;s name....Best Ever Banana Nut Bread!,5

Next time I am going to try 3/4 cup of sugar. It&#39;s just a matter of tasting the batter and if it needs more add it. I always under estimate the sugar and it usually works for me. If your having a party try the mini cup  or the regular cup cake pans these will be the hit of the party. You can&#39;t go wrong with the recipe.",5

1,0,0,0,100,<p>Turned out fabulously!  I loved how easy the chicken was to shred up.  I was a bit concerned when I started to make it thinking the lime and chili seasoning wasn&#39;t enough and the recipe would burn but it didn&#39;t and made it&#39;s own juices with it.  The only suggestion I have is to heat it longer than 30mins.  The finished product made a lot.  Was a bit drippy but was still very good.  Had plenty leftover meat mixture and used it for lunch the following date and crushed up some organic blue tortilla chips and mixed in with it.  Super yummy that way too!  Overall happy with this and would make it again since my picky family really enjoyed it</p>,4
1,0,0,0,100,these were delicious and very easy ....and to those who complain...I followed the receipt to the tee and had wonderful results....I find that when u change something then yu are bound to have something go wrong.....,4

1,0,0,0,100,"To MaikoEmi, after reading your review I thought not doing it. When I checked at 25 minutes, there were lots of liquid, I had to set the oven at 375 for another 25 minutes or more until it was drier. I think you did not waited until the liquid evaporated. Actually it is pretty good and not soft at all.",5

1,0,1,0,193,"This recipe is AMAZING!!! I am a complete Newbie when it comes to bread. I can make pizza dough like a pro but bread has always intimidated me.  Using bread flour in my recipe was my first priority, second was no milk or egg.  This recipe was easy to follow and ended up with a bread better than the bakery (my picky eater&#39;s words)!  I used a dough hook on my mixer and after was pulled together, i hand kneaded it for about 4 minutes longer.  The most perfect bread ever!!!  Don&#39;t be intimidated, just follow written directions fully.  ONLY thing I would add is to put the rack toward the bottom so the &#34;poof&#34; of the bread is in the middle of the oven when it&#39;s risen and browning.  THANK YOU AGAIN!!!",5

1,0,0,0,100,Made this for hubby and me today and we really like it! Ingredients are quite spendy and it is also not a low cal meal. I think it would be a very elegant dish for special occasions with friends and family-a lot for two to eat. I wonder how well it will keep and reheat.,5

It truly is the best one that I&#39;ve ever tasted and &#34;hubby&#34; said the same, with rating it to be a &#34;10&#34; in goodness.  I exchanged white sugar for raw, organic cane sugar and used 1/4 cup less sugar.  I also used organic bananas that were very ripe and organic eggs. This one definately go in my BEST foot recipe category.  Yum...!",5
1,0,0,0,100,Left out the Italian dressing. Used corn tortillas. Did not use enough. I only made one layer of torn tortillas. Next time I would use more. Since I suspected there weren&#39;t enough I sprayed tortillas and baked them the last 5 minutes of the casserole so we had chips. I added refried beans along with the black beans and stirred in Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. We loved it.,5

1,0,8,0,404,I made these for the 1st time a couple weeks ago. I didn’t have any poppyseeds so left those out and I couldn’t find any horseradish “spread” at my local grocery store so I used just the tiniest pinch of regular prepared horseradish on the bottom of each bun. I also could only let them sit in the fridge for about an hour before we needed to eat lunch that day. My teenage daughter who is THE pickiest eater on planet Earth loved them. Tomorrow night I am making a double batch of the sauce and pouring it over baked chicken breasts for a quick and easy dinner. I’m also planning on making the sauce and pouring it over plain Hawaiian rolls and baking them at Easter for a quick and easy and DIFFERENT side for Easter dinner! The sauce is the Boss lol! Soooooo tasty!,5
1,0,0,1,100,"Very yummy! My mom always made these growing up. The only problem I have with the recipe, is there’s too much milk and makes the mixture too soupy.

1,0,1,0,193,"I have been making these for years.  We live out of the USA and store-bought sauce is not available.  I was glad for the sauce recipe.   The people in the country I live love garlic.  To them the more garlic the better the taste in any main dish.  I reduce the amount of flour to the consistency that I like.  As for the taco mix and taco itself, I make my own soft tacos from a recipe as that is the best we can do here.  My soft taco is rolled very thin and pan-fried before I fill them.

1,0,0,1,100,This recipe is fabulous as written but still not simple enough for my teenagers to prepare without complaints.  When it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones.  We usually use matchstick carrots so we don&#39;t have to chop.  IF we use bacon we use real bacon pieces (such as Hormel) like you can find in the salad section of the store.  We usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since I don&#39;t have bacon grease to use.  Because I use canned potatoes I only heat it through before I add the ham and cheese.  The whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers.,5

I also had no Horseradish sauce so used mayonnaise on both the top and bottom of the rolls. I also did not leave them over night in the fridge. Made up early in the morning  worked out just fine.

Then I put the chicken in a hot skillet with all the marinade. Let it heat a min before tossing in all the peppers and onion. Then I cooked it all til my preferred doneness of veggies.",5

1,0,2,0,686,"Great recipe--it does a wonderful job of &#34;disguising&#34; the healthy ingredients.  However, it has WAY too much sugar in it for me.  I doubled the recipe to make it the same as my regular pancake recipe--meaning it now calls for 2/3 cup sugar!  My normal pancake recipe only has 2 tablespoons of sugar for the same amount of flour/oats.  Because we use syrup on our pancakes I don&#39;t feel like I need my pancakes to be sweet too--its just added sugar that is unnecessary.  So, next time I will reduce the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a delicious recipe.   (also they brown quickly due to all the brown sugar in the recipe, just turn down the heat so they cook a little more slowly and you&#39;ll be fine)",4

This was really good for what could be a 4 ingredient recipe.This could be adapted so many ways, but it is surprisingly good for such a simple recipe!",5
1,0,1,3,120,"I chose this one of many I found because of its rating; however, it was just barely okay.I reduced the sugar in the syrup by a half -- there&#39;s enough sugar in the crumb mixture and the apples -- and it was still a bit too sweet. The topping was heavy in both texture and taste -- perhaps too much oatmeal. I noticed more dessert left on the plates of family members who usually clean them down to the porcelain. I&#39;ll look for another recipe.",2

Never used capers cuz I never knew what they were and never had them but even without those, this recipe is really good! It’s very light and airy. Pair it with some rice and broccoli and you got yourself a quick affordable meal. Also, to the person saying this recipe is bland. I recommend using the lemon butter mixture before you cook them and when they come out put more of the mixture on it. This helps with the flavor. Btw if you’re not a huge fan of lemons like me, I would probably use alittle less lemon juice than it asks for cuz the lemon can get pretty bold compared to the other flavors. This makes a great meal prep also!!",5

I substituted leftover pan-fried tofu and one lightly scrambled egg in place of the ground pork, used pre-packaged coleslaw mix and about 1.5 cups of shredded carrot and then topped off the finished produce with a sprinkling of peanuts and Sriracha sauce.  I love someone&#39;s idea of using spicy mustard and/or sweet and sour sauce in the future!  Will definitely be making this again!",5

Served it with cheesy Italian monkey bread. The flavor was GREAT!!! My only complaint was that with the broth, it was a thinner consistency than what I was hoping for, and I guess I didn&#39;t mash my beans enough to make it thicker. Otherwise we really liked it!!!!",4
20,0,0,0,540,"These were really good bars!  I had a 1/2 can of strawberry pie filling to use up so I only made 1/4 of the bar recipe (but used 1/2 the glaze recipe to pipe on top and made it a really thick consistency, topping once they were completely cool).  I made this in an 8x8 baking dish and it came out perfect, although I did allow it to bake for 50 minutes.  Next time I&#39;ll try 1/2 the recipe in a 13x9.  I think the key is to have a thin layer of bar on the bottom and increase the time a bit to assure it&#39;s done.  I didn&#39;t use the almond extract, that seemed odd to me, but will try the almond slivers like others.  I&#39;ll be making these for company in the future, I think they&#39;d be wonderful on a brunch buffet!",5

I used whole fat half and half cuz I couldn&#39;t find fat free.  I made the roux in a separate pot, using about 1/4 cup of flour instead of 1/3, and stirred it into the potato clam juice mixture.  My potatoes were soft but a little teeny bit firm at about 12 minutes.  I found that I didn&#39;t really need very much thinning at the end so I used only about 1/4 cup of the half and half there.  Result was a lovely delicious thick and creamy chowder that is the best I&#39;ve ever made.  Served it with fresh baguette bread and butter.

I did not change one thing in the recipe.  If you&#39;re a chocolate peanut butter fan who also likes cheesecake, you have to try this!  One warning, though.  I made homemade fudge sauce for the top, but the recipe I have gets hard when chilled.  Luckily, I had time to go to the store and buy a jar because the other would have been too hard to cut through without tearing the cake apart.

The amount of flour you use isn&#39;t going to exactly match what is in this recipe.  (or any recipe)  The amount varies depending on temperature and humidity.  If it&#39;s cool and/or dry in your house, you will use less flour.  You will have to adjust by feel and texture as you knead the dough.  Don&#39;t add all the flour at once.   It also helps to have a small pan with some water on the rack below the bread pan.  This adds additional humidity while you bake the bread. (Giving a nicer crust)",0

None of my ingredients are fat or sugar free or low fat. I used two Jiffy cake mixes.  I was out of instant pudding, so I used the Cook &amp; Serve pudding, cooled it and mixed it in with the cream cheese. The pudding blends nicely with the cream cheese.

What I&#39;ve started doing is mixing all of the filling together - ground beef, onion, pepper, water, taco seasoning, black beans and diced tomatoes - I also started mixing in the refried beans so it&#39;s simpler to put together and the taste is the same :-)  Then I divide the entire recipe in half.  I use 3 tortillas, half the filling and half the cheese and make up a 8x8 dish.  Then I take the remaining half of just the filling and freeze it in a freezer container.

I sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting. I added the dried basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes when I added the broth and tomatoes (I did not add any water) so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out. (I used more seasoning than recipe called for and used 2 heaping tsps of dried basil, 1 tsp of black pepper, and added 3/4 tsp red pepper to suit our need for heat)I also added 3 tbs of chicken bouillon and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant.

The bake time at the top says 70 mins and in the recipe itself it says 1 hr 20 mins or until the tooth pick comes out clean.  I have made this 3 times and it takes about 60 mins at the most at 325 degrees.  Let the bread rest in the pan for 5-10 mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack.

For the topping, you need to let it boil for a bit and reduce before pouring on the batter, think like syrup or even a caramel consistency.

Obviously, the amount of flour and water depends very much on the temperature, humidity, and elevation, so it would have been helpful to be very specific about what the dough should look and feel like at each stage, since this is a beginner’s recipe.

I don&#39;t like adding flavouring cubes, granules or liquids if they contain MSG and other chemicals I check for - I&#39;d rather get flavour from natural sources so my allergies don&#39;t act up, plus it&#39;s healthier. I have used corn and peas, also mixed frozen veggies and peas and carrots - whatever I have on hand - or am in the mood for. I have been known to make the meat and veggie mixture - in multiples of the amount in this recipe -  in a Dutch oven so I can freeze some for later use. Have also added mushrooms, fresh (preferably) or canned. I always grind a generous amount of pepper into the base - always taking samples for tasting before  calling it complete - the same with salt - which I go easy on. The sour cream is a nice twist and I have also used cream cheese in the base. Sooooo many possibilities! Thanks for sharing.",4

I didn’t enjoy the horseradish flavor. Just a personal preference, but next time I’ll use mayo instead. I doubled the sauce &amp; used a pkg of 8 sweet rolls. I had to put 2 of them in a pan all by themselves, which turned out to be a happy accident because it left more space around them for the sauce to caramelize so when you cut to separate them, more of the thin, crispy-chewy sauce stuck around the edges. So you got more of the savory-sweet chewy toffee for each sandwich. Next time I make them, I’ll bake fewer in each pan so this will happen to all of them.",5

Alternate flour mixture and milk. Do not beat, mix well. 375 oven, 25mins. Test at 20 mins. Test with toothpick. Now we only made a layer cake. Always this chocolate frosting. 4 Tablespoon butter, 4 ounces unsweetened Hershey’s chocolate, melt together. 3cups sifted confectioners sugar, 1teaspoon vanilla, 1/8 teaspoon salt. 1/3 cup warm milk. Add not all milk at once to sugar and chocolate mix now add rest of milk. Frost cake, serve warm. My mom always put 4 toothpicks to hold cake together, who ever gat a toothpick got another piece of cake. This tradition still goes own. ENJOY! Sandra",0

Then remove the pork chops, add 1 tablespoon to the drippings in the pan, add more seasoning if needed, then add 1 cup milk.  Cook on medium heat until thick.  Slice potatoes and onions and layer in a baking dish.  Pour gravy over the potatoes and onions, then top with the pork chops.  Bake at 400 degrees, covered, for 45 minutes.

It was definitely not as thick as the picture.  Seemed to take quite awhile (at least 2 hours) for the gelatin layer to partially set. Then again, maybe it set too much because it seemed to slide off the cream cheese layer once it was cut. I like the idea of using a 16 oz. container of fresh strawberries instead of the frozen.",4

I also used crushed red pepper flakes to add some spice because franks hot sauce contains garlic powder. :),5

Thus, the cupcakes didn&#39;t set fast enough in the oven and had &#34;hat brims&#34; of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice dome.I also made half of the frosting (as suggested by previous reviewers) and it covered all 30 (not 24 as the recipe claims) cupcakes nicely. The frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for (what I think is) a lot of cinnamon.As to why frosting might not be setting up (as mentioned by Alie0717): If you make cream cheese frosting with low-fat (Neufchatel cheese) or fat-free cream cheese, it doesn&#39;t have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting. Soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only full-fat or regular cream cheese.

I used regular fat half &amp; half and an extra can of clams.  I did use the extra juice from that extra can as well.  The soup thickened quickly and stayed that way, so adding the extra liquids made it just the right consistency for us.  For our tastes, I also added about 1 Tbsp. of Kosher salt.

When chicken is done, scoop out the chicken. Use the same oil to cook the sauce. Remember to season the sauce with salt &amp; sugar (up to you). Put the chicken into the sauce and stir a while.

I slice the top off, put the bottom half in the 9x13, layer on the toppings and put the top back on.  We don&#39;t use the horseradish or butter or anything inside of the sandwiches.  I use a large knife to cut through everything after they are done cooking.  We use 1/4 tsp. Onion Powder because we don&#39;t like onions.

Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey and instead of the Velveeta I used 4 ounces cream cheese and 8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar.  Because ground turkey really does not require draining I cooked the ground turkey and veggies all at the same time.  Also, if you like condiments on your burgers you can always squeeze a little bit into each individual serving (might be a great suggestion for making this recipe even more kid friendly).  I found that Dijon mustard works really well.  This will be a regular go-to recipe for me.",5

I wanted to avoid the common complaint that the rice expanded and got gummy as it sat in the refrigerator.  The only change I would make is add more green pepper and reduce the amount of fluid.  I cooked this on the stove for a couple of hours, adding fluid as needed.  I used beef broth and a bit of water, and only 1 beef bouillon cube.",5

The bread comes out good, if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center. My girlfriend says it’s too salty so I’m trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt. I thought the salt was fine but I want her to eat the bread too so, less salt. And I tried it with honey instead of sugar, but it didn’t look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar. The yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but wasn’t bubbling, so I put sugar in there with the honey too. I will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time.

1,0,55,87,649,"I never do these but I read the reviews and made the macaroons.  It never ceases to amaze me how people can supposedly follow the same recipe with such different results.  Toll house cookies being the prime example.  Anyway, sorry, I did change it a little.  I have made macaroons before and just wanted to experiment--however, I didn&#39;t change any measurements just tweaked things a little.  I used almond flour, rum instead of vanilla, added some candied ginger and a dark chocolate button on top.  They&#39;re fabulous but I mainly wanted to mention how they came together.  They didn&#39;t but I piled them in heaps on the cookie sheet, anyway, and they&#39;re fine.  Also, this recipe with no change in amounts on the ingredients, made 23 big macaroons.  Macaroons are so rich and sweet and, basically unhealthy, most recipes don&#39;t recommend making them very big.  Can&#39;t figure out how people could think the recipe doesn&#39;t make enough.  Last of all, I think the freshness of the eggs makes a difference.  Staler egg whites are watery.  I could have used a little of that.",4

My husband &#34; the red meat eater&#34;, said it would be a toss up between my notorious prime rib meal, or this new recipe. It was easy to make, and the flavor undescribable.

I&#39;ve never been one to put salsa on my tacos or burritos (I&#39;m more of a pico de gallo person), this was super good. It also made enough that I&#39;m going to definitely get more than a few meals out of it. Easy, quick and cheap.By the way, I bought a can of corn, accidentally got creamed corn, and (while this was the first time I made this, so I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s supposed be exactly), I don&#39;t think it changed anything. The salsa has enough liquid that it got absorbed without an issue.I&#39;m definitely making this again.",5

Then slice up the peppers and onions and put in a separate bag.  When it comes time to cook, just defrost the chicken in the fridge... the peppers and onions can be cooked right from the freezer.

I don&#39;t use much, just enough for squiggles on top. Flavorings like almond extract can also be added by the teaspoon after microwaving.",5

Cook it for a few minutes to get rid of the flour taste.  If it&#39;s too thick to stir, add a bit more butter, then proceed to add your liquid.

The only tweaks I made to it are: - No Carrots:  They make the soup too sweet. - Cheese:  I prefer using real cheese like medium cheddar or colby rather than the Velveeta. It melts fast if you shred it. On occasion I&#39;ll use 1/2 (or less) of the Velveeta and substitute the other half  with actual cheddar or colby. Real cheese will always taste better. - On occasion I&#39;ll use broccoli instead of potatoes - viola you have broccoli cheese soup!,5

1,0,20,2,424,"Part 2... If you bake them a bit longer than recommended the crust holds up better in bar form.  I often bake them 45-50 mins at home.  Never had a burnt crust.  The convection ovens at the bakery were definitely faster.  If they come out with softer crust just cut into smaller “2-bite” size pieces or eat with fork.  The batter is very thick.  Fist time I made I I though I did something wrong. You can easily alter the amount of sugar to your liking.  Change up the filings, extracts and nuts or other add-in’s as you choose.  It’s pretty forgiving.  It’s kinda bad hard to mess up this recipe. Under-baking is usually the biggest issue, as is not using enough filling.  At a bakery you can’t skimp on fillings.  Customers don’t like that :-).  If you do add the drizzle on top it will make the bars a bit wet it the sit out all day.   Bakery tip: For dryer drizzle use less milk.  It should be very thick - as in “not a drizzle at all” but kinda toothpaste like.  Then heat in microwave, no more than 10 seconds at a time. Gets super hot very fast.  Once hot, drizzle quickly, as it will harden/get crusty very quickly.  Once it drys on the bars it won’t make them overly soft.  Works great and you can remix remaining crusted drizzle (with few drops of liquid) and reheat if it gets too difficult to work with.  I burned myself a few times with the hot mix so be careful not to overheat it",4

The other batch I skip the horseradish and put a tiny smear of apricot, peach or marmalade jam on the bottom bun.  Leave out the onion in the butter sauce topper and use sesame seeds to differentiate between the two versions.  Both are huge hits!  Be sure to cut the ham and cheese to &#34;roll size&#34; before you put them together as it mskes them so much easier to cut for serving after they&#39;re baked.  Some vidros on the internet call for jyst laying large whole slices of ham overlapping on the bottom buns.  But then there&#39;s a huge mess when you try to cut them apart after baking. Avoid it by having the ham and cheese fit on the individual buns to start with!",5

My guess is person who commented they had too much jello followed recipe on Jello box and not this recipe. I sliced up frozen strawberries as I didn’t have pre-sliced and added them when not completely thawed to act as substitute for cold water and it worked.

I may need to tweek it a little so the roux is pourable instead of a lumpy paste.",4

Try using tomato paste with a little Worchestershire sauce stirred in for your topping with bell pepper rings for garnish (I like the yellow ones).  Instead of a runnier sauce you will have a tangier topping that is absorbed into the flavor of the meatloaf in the top layer.  Change the saltines to seasoned bread crumbs (Italian or Garlic seasoned), add chopped sundried tomatoes to bring hints of the tomato tang throughout the meatloaf and use chopped sweet Hawaiian onions for a flavor balance.",3

I used cream of celery soup ( because I like the layer of flavor it adds) I too added 1C diced celery and shredded carrots.

I didn&#39;t have any turkey so I sprinkled some Southwestern style seasoning on a package of chicken thighs after removing the skin and baked them.  When the thighs cooled off I chopped them up and added them to the chili.  I usually cook this on the stove top since I &#39;m not patient enough to wait for the slow cooker.  I made a double batch and poured as much as I could fit into the slow cooker the next morning.  Several coworkers took some of the leftovers home for dinner.

The top layer of my crust was still raw after 25 mins, so I added 13 more minutes...it was then half- undercooked, so I added 10 more minutes and adjusted to 400 degrees.

1,0,0,0,100,For those that had an overwhelming thyme taste use dried thyme LEAVES .....NOT ground thyme. Fresh thyme works best in my opinion..... especially if you can find lemon thyme. (It is easy to grow too. Best in 12x12 x12  inches deep pots and potting soil. Use started  small plants rather than seeds. So easy and cheaper in the long runI like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well. The only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand. I save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer. ,4

I probably used a little extra apple sauce (made it myself with sliced apples and oil and cooked till soft)  and not quite enuf bananas.

Left the potato amount the same &amp; added more cheese.  Left out the sour cream since it tasted good as is.  All you need is crusty bread &amp; a pickle!",4

That might vary based on the top of apple.My crust turned out great! But even with 5 extra minutes, my apples still weren&#39;t tender enough. I used Honeycrisp and a few golden delicious. I wish now that I&#39;d either tried another reviewer&#39;s tip of covering the whole top with tin foil (so I could have baked it longer), or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for 5  minutes to give them a head start. P.S. I probably would have chosen Jonathans or Jonagolds if my store had them. :-/",4

I bought a regular sized cake mix and just split it in half (1.25 cups of the mix).  I baked it cholesterol free by using egg whites and applesauce in place of oil.  Then I followed the instructions as directed, except that I used neufchatel cheese instead of fat free cream cheese because it has even fewer calories, and then I omitted the walnuts because my husband doesn&#39;t like them.  So with even less calories, I increased the serving size so there were 16 slices instead of 20.  It was excellent!  Even my 4-year old ate a whole piece!  Very light dessert, not too sweet, and full of flavor and texture.  We really liked it a lot.",5

I wasn&#39;t sure what you meant by topping either, sounds like a cheaper brand of topping and not syrup will have the caramel sink to the bottom.  I kind of have  an issue with TOH in general, in that this takes way more than 30 minutes to make.  In general, your recipes, all the ingredients are prepared - pecans chopped, cream cheese softened and then you start the timer, I wish you would put your times in as if starting from scratch.

You HAVE to let the pretzel mixture cool COMPLETELY before adding the filling or the whipped cream just melts and there’s no texture.

For the &#34;pumpkin spice&#34; we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg, about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove, and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoon.For my palate, I&#39;d add even more spice in the future, likely the nutmeg and clove, but generally the spice level seems good for most people. I decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup, and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future, along with adding about 1/4 cup more cream cheese. We also added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a vanilla bean (split the bean and scrape out), along with the cinnamon, which made it a really rich tasting frosting.If you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way, and  the cupcakes look professionally made, nice to take to parties and holiday events.

Well, I must say, this is ONE delicious casserole!  The zucchini &#34;crust&#34; is so cheesy and delicious... it could be a side dish on it&#39;s own!  The hamburger topping just finishes it off perfectly.  The only thing I did different was to use a jar of pizza sauce instead of Italian tomato sauce and I used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of chopped onion.  This is a very good recipe... on my meal rotation now.",5

I followed the how to cook the frozen pie instructions but my pie was still cold after it should&#39;ve been ready - it took an additional 45 minutes and I increased the oven temperature. It was still tasty - just disappointed it took a long time too cook through.",5

1,0,3,0,297,"A very easy and excellent recipe. It&#39;s not going to be that thick chili-consistency, but the heat level is nice and kid-friendly as advertised. I made a few slight alterations: I used about 1 lb of chicken and 1 additional can of beans, since we like our chilies and soups on the chunkier side. I reduced the broth to 2 cups and used liquid from the canned beans when I crushed the 1/2 cup of beans as directed - though I did this with a fork, so it wasn&#39;t perfectly smooth.  The flavors are a nice blend, although I think I will increase the oregano and cumin to compensate for having more chicken and beans next time. The additions of cheese, avocado, and cherry tomatoes are delicious, and oyster crackers are good, too. My very picky son ate seconds - unprompted! Definitely a winner in my book!",4
1,0,13,1,847,"I was all set to make this and realized I didn&#39;t have enough of any shaped pasta, so I substituted angel hair. I followed the recipe as written and we all loved it. Now I always use angel hair and I do double the sauce amount.",5

1,0,43,13,388,This is really good!!!  I sautéd the carrots and onions in a bit of the bacon grease for more flavor. I used a bit celery salt and Yukon gold potatoes since that’s what I had. I used a very small amount of Velveeta for its creaminess and for the rest I used aged cheddar cheese.,5
1,0,1,0,193,"I made this as a test to see if it&#39;s what I wanted to take to a bridal shower.  It was great!  I did follow the advice of one lady and made it with 12 eggs and 30 oz hash browns so it would be a little bigger. Being from the Southwest, you can&#39;t make an egg dish without throwing in green chili.  I bought the frozen kind and drained it before adding. Since it was bigger I baked it an hour.",5
1,0,0,0,100,This is great and easy to make. I did add an extra banana which made it more moist but it is not needed. I also used 4 mini loaf pans and baked them 40 minutes. I have made other banana breads and this is my favorite.,5
1,0,0,0,100,I&#39;ve been making a variation of this for years.  My husband loves it.Tip:  it&#39;s way easier to add the extra butter and then the flour to the celery and onion mixture than it is to make a separate roux.  You have more control over how thick your soup will be and you don&#39;t have to mess up an extra pan.  It&#39;s an extra step that&#39;s very unnecessary.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"This was on the cover and pg58 of the latest issue and I decided to try it for a formal dinner dance I was attending. I was pleased that I had all the ingredients and that the directions were very simple.  It was easy to make and then when i put it together the next day it came together beautifully--best frosting. So yummy! It was so fancy when sliced and displayed and all my close friends were demanding slices as soon as they saw it. My dessert was the first to go and EVERYONE declared it to be one of the best chocolate cakes they had ever had. The balance of the sour cream with the sugar kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet and it was more old school in recipe without the white sugar and with the boiling water and sour cream. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet bakers chocolate. The frosting is plentiful and delicious. And for a garnish, I crushed up some chocolate chips and dusted the top. It was a massive hit. Everyone declared it to be so moist and to taste like it came from a bakery. Definitely an awesome cake. Will be making it again for Thanksgiving.",5

Probably the taste buds in the mid-west are far different than other regions. If you&#39;re concerned about soybean oil then I know there are other mayo&#39;s you buy. Or make your mayo from scratch. I find it unfair that someone would call this a loser or anyone&#39;s recipe a loser. Just simply state that if it was not for your taste buds instead of insulting someone&#39;s recipe. That might have hurt their feelings. I frankly thought when I saw that...I will not dare share any of my families recipes because of how insulting people can be. In this day.",5

This is something I&#39;d do also.  Did you make any other alterations other than boiling the liquid a bit? I am anxious to try this, but would like to hear from you first.  Thanks so much. ",0

I did cheat by using a good quality frozen crust, I beat my egg white nicely and brushed a good bit all over the crust and then gave it a generous sprinkling of sugar. My top crust was made by using a maple leaf cookie cutter stamp and just covering the entire top of the pie with leaves. I just love how pretty it makes the pie! Just beautiful for Fall!

1,0,26,2,877,"This is delicious!  I usually make it a few times a month in the fall and winter as it is one of the few meals that everyone in my family will eat.  I’ve adapted it a little to suit my family’s tastes.  I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddars instead of Velveeta, and I use a combination of peeled russet (all purpose) potatoes and unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes as I like the different textures.  Sour cream is not something that I keep on hand, so I rarely add it in.  We drink fat free milk, so I often use that instead of buying whole milk  just for using in this recipe.   To change things up from time to time, in place of ground beef, I’ve used both ground and link sausages (sliced thin) and cubed ham.  I’ve also left the meat out altogether and doubled the potatoes.  When using ground meat, I typically use a whole pound instead of a half pound.  Any way I make it, we like to sprinkle some bacon on top!  Enjoy!",0
20,0,3,1,235,"i made this last night for dinner. It went together very fast and based on another reviewer, I added 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of the sour cream. I accidently added too much cayenne so I did offer sour cream at the table along with shredded cheese. Personally, I am not much of a fan of beans of any kind, but this chili was good. The only problem was it did not make enough for the hearty appetites for all the people at the table. Next time I make this I will double the recipe. But this is a keeper even by my standards.",5

I tweeked the recipe a little bit. I used a bigger pan and i used one whole jar of sauce on the bottom,  then layered the frozen bag of ravioli on top off sauce and pushed down into the sauce then layered the hamburger on ravioli. Poured another jar of sauce all over the layers. Used the whole 2 cup bag of cheese, plus a little bit more,  which made a nice layer over everything. To top it off, I covered the shredded cheese with single layer of pepperoni. Cooked 45 minutes at 400, and served.

I&#39;d rather have a small piece of the real deal than a bigger piece of artificial sweeteners, fat free whatever, etc.  So, the changes I made upon reading the reviews were:  to the cake, I added a tsp. of orange extract, used three whole eggs (as called for on the cake mix box) instead of egg whites and used canola oil instead of applesauce.To the topping, I used regular instant pudding and regular frozen whipped topping.",5

I thought the apples could have cooked a little longer, I used Gala, next time I might try a different one.  I will  definitely be making this again.",5
1,0,2,0,253,"This turned out perfectly. I read previous reviews before trying this one. The problem with a lot of recipes is lack of details. Have your marshmallow creme jar open, and your peanut butter - I used Jif No Stir Natural Creamy Peanut Butter. already measured out. Prep your pan before you start. I line a 7&#34;x10&#34; glass pan lined with parchment. You must first bring the milk (I used evaporated milk) and sugar to a full boil - one that does not go away when stirred. I usually start with medium-high to get the boil going, then back off to medium once it&#39;s boiling.  You must stir constantly. Begin your 3 minute timing once the mixture comes to a full boil. Take the pan off the heat! I immediately stirred in a tsp of vanilla. Now you&#39;ve got to work quickly. Add your peanut butter and marshmallow creme.  Stir with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined. Pour into your prepared pan. Let it cool completely at room temperature. To cut it, just lift it our with the parchment paper and place it on your cutting surface. Cut into 1&#34; squares because it&#39;s quite rich. LOVE this recipe! Plenty of peanut butter flavor for me.",5

1,0,2,0,253,"So good!  To eliminate the bread not releasing from the pan do this:  Cut waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan after you spray the pan bottom to hold the wax paper tightly.   Spray the paper after it is in the pan.  After baking, run a knife around the sides to release the bread.  Turn the pan upside down and the bread will slide out.Peal off the wax paper.  Do not spray the sides of the pan to allow the batter to rise and form a nice loaf.  I do this for all of my dessert breads.  I double this recipe and pour it into 3 -  8&#34;x 4&#34; pans and freeze 2 of the loaves.  If making a single recipe I use a 9&#34; x 5&#34; pan.  If doubling, I cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and I don&#39;t add nuts at all.  I brush the glaze over the sides and then drizzle the rest of the glaze over the top.  Wonderful recipe!",5

It tastes just as delicious as the first time when it turned out perfectly, but looks very unappetizing. I tell my kids..just eat it with your eyes closed! LOLAny suggestions would be so appreciated.

One thing I do is add espresso powder, though.  It&#39;s almost a knee-jerk reaction for me to find some way to add more flavor to a baked item that requires water than simply adding water. Substituting the water with hot coffee or just adding a teaspoon or so of espresso powder to the boiling water is a great way to accent the chocolate flavor. Wonderful recipe!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"No wonder this recipe is a contest winner. It was delicious - very flavorful - and hearty. I used a total of two 32 oz Swanson chicken broth boxes because I thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing... I was glad I did. I did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth, which my bigger boxes of broth took care of. I skipped the can of diced tomatoes because I&#39;m not a fan but I can see how they would add to the soup for others. The recipe calls for turkey sausage but I used regular Italian sausage and it calls for 12 oz but I had 16 oz so I used the whole thing. For the  refrigerated tortellini, I used the tiny cheese raviolettis that Buitoni offers. I used fresh spinach from one of the 9 oz &#34;salad&#34; bags (probably used about 7 oz of it and didn&#39;t chop it up) and I did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because I love it. I used more than a dash of red pepper... did a couple of shakes. We did put shredded parmesan on top and I highly recommend.

I don’t like Italian dressing so used 1/3 cup v-8 juice instead of ¼ c It dressing.  Next time I will boost it to 1/2 or 2/3 c if I use the extra gr. turkey again.

1,0,0,0,100,We love this!  I make it using shredded coleslaw rather than chop up a head of cabbage.  We also use gluten free noodles and gluten free soy sauce so my 10 year old granddaughter with diet restrictions can eat it.  (I tried using the angel hair type rice noodles and prefer it with a firmer noodle.)   I added two slightly beaten eggs to the cooked pork and cabbage for a reason.  Years ago I made egg rolls for Asian friends and they told me I forgot to add the egg.  Adding the egg does not alter the taste of the egg roll noodle bowl ingredients.,5

(I didn&#39;t realize this was a double recipe though!) since it made enough for two pot pies I gave one away and they really enjoyed it to. The only thing I will change next time is so skip the corn and add two cups of green peas just because I think it looks prettier with more green in it.",5

Added jalapenos with the bell peppers and Yellow onion, it was pretty dang spicy but I like a lot of heat. Also I added some of the marinade from inside the bag to the pan with all the veggies and put a lid on for the first 10 minutes to effectively steam them before blackening them on high. Served the whole thing on rice with refried black beans mixed in. Note: this recipe would also be great on nachos if you dice the chicken smaller or cook it whole and shred it.",5

I always use Yukon Gold potatoes to make mashed potatoes with--it really ratchets up the flavor.

Update--9/21/2017:  I am scheduled for foot surgery soon and cannot stand for long periods of time SO I made this even quicker.

This turned out great! I did a few swap outs, because teenager 🙄😑 I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I 100% recommend putting soup over your rice, or grain of choice.

I would cut one of the sugars in half, also I did not listen others and increase the flour, but It may have helped the runnyness. It was not runny per say but could have used a bit of extra thickener.  Lastly I made this in a regular round metal cake pan with the same cooking time and it worked out great.

It does not have a “coffee” taste, in case someone is curious; it is not “overly” chocolate, but just right.  I’ve doubled it before when making my kids multi-layered, multi-shaped birthday cakes. Everyone always complements it!! I have made the frosting listed in the recipe, but have made other “favorite” frostings instead, too, mostly because I don’t use shortening. I use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly. Someone said the center comes out raw....the recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is. However, it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time. I typically average a few extra minutes and it’s perfect!!! It also does freeze great, without frosting. When I’m making shaped birthday cakes, I freeze my cut-off extra pieces as I’m layering and then take them out for a later day. Sometimes, I frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving, but not always. They’re great without it too.",5

I LOVE a robust, full of deep flavour ginger cookie and each time I have tried a recipe (I have tried about 3, I have ALWAYS regretted not adding more of the spices). The alteration I made was: 3 tsp Ginger (instead of 2 tsp), 1 tsp Cloves (instead of 1/2 tsp) and 1.5 tsp Cinnamon (instead of 3/4 tsp). Also, as per previous reviews, I used 3/4 Cup Brown Sugar (Instead of 1 Cup White sugar). I also added in 1/3 cup molasses instead of the 1/4 cup!These where phenomenal!! nice and THICK, just like I was hoping for. Countless recipes before yielded thin, weightless cookies, that lacked in depth of flavour. Whereas these are thick, hearty and chewy. If you liked a fuller spiced cookie I would definitely recommend adding in the extra. I also didn&#39;t miss the added sugar because they were rolled in it anyway ;)",5

I followed the recipe exactly.....did cut down on the sugar in the topping to about a third cup of each the brown and white sugars....maybe will reduce them down even more when I make this again..... and put it in an 11 x 7 inch baking dish (it still bubbled over a bit).  I can&#39;t see why one person thought it had too many &#34;flaws&#34; and why some are so spooked by the fact that there&#39;s one and a half cups of water in the topping!  There are many dessert recipes where you use a lot of liquid like this to pour over the main part of the dessert....it combines with the flour and creates that lovely thick sauce that was underneath the cake-like topping and peaches.  Someone even contemplated leaving the topping off....that would be disastrous!  Follow the recipe as it&#39;s written, use nice, juicy ripe peaches, and it makes a terrific cobbler.  Of course, there&#39;s the matter of taste......not everyone agrees completely about how something tastes to them, but there are no flaws in this recipe.

It might have been because I used old fashion oats instead of quick-cooking. Running the old fashion oats through the food processor might have helped with the texture. I really dislike crisp cookies so I made them a little bigger than the rounded tsp and baked them for 8 minutes, but found even that to be too long! I ended up baking for 6 minutes and letting cool on the cookie sheet for 1.5 minutes before removing to a wire rack. They didn&#39;t really spread at all. I used chocolate pudding mix because that&#39;s what I had and I think it was too chocolatey; I also decreased the chips to 1.5 cups. Sorry, but I won&#39;t be repeating these.

Second, even with  3 pans a whole cup of nuts on top was too much. I should have put 1 1/2 cups of nuts in the batter and a 1/2 cup for sprinkling on top. I did 2 with glaze and 1 without. I definitely liked the glaze.  Letting the bread completely cool is important to allow it to set. It is too crumbly when you try to cut it while still warm.",0

1,0,6,2,284,"This recipe is elevated from a 4 star to a 5 star with the following tweaks.... First, I only use 1/4 c water in the meat mixture, and add an egg to help bind the ingredients when mixing - otherwise they tend to fall apart. I use a quick rice. Also, I microwave the onion in a tsp of water for 1.5 minutes before mixing in with rest of ingredients. Most importantly, I make 1.5 times the sauce by increasing all of the ingredients by 1.5 except the water, which I leave at 1c. (I use Italian seasoned tomato sauce.) This way we have plenty of sauce, as we like to enjoy this dish over mashed potatoes.  PS: Remember to cover the dish while cooking or your rice may not get done!

I soaked grills overnight and the used oven cleaner. Our gerni high pressure cleaner still could not remove the vharred marinate. The brown sugar hardens like cement and i ended up using a hammer and screwdriver to try and get it to let go. Next time i will use a disposable foil grill on top of the bbq burners.,5
1,0,1,0,193,"Fabulous! My family asks for this. Rhubarb is the key ingredient here. I mix the sugar &amp; flour &amp; rhubarb (more like 6 cups chopped VERY FINE) and let it set while I prepare the other parts. When making the cookie bottom I don&#39;t press it down real tight. For sure, don&#39;t overbake the bottom.  It&#39;s better to eat it like fall apart cake than to have it overcooked &amp; dry.  Ask me how I know. Smile.  Also, bake it in glass, not metal. I love Jaslyn&#39;s suggestions &amp; I plan to try them but this recipe is great as is. It tastes great warm out of the oven AND cold the next day.  Oh, and it makes a lot. It could easily be halved.  And one more thing, I have been making these bars since the recipe was first published in the magazines in 1988 I just never added a rating. Taste of Home fan here!",5

You can increase the buttermilk to 1 C. to make the batter more pourable and the pancakes will still come out light and fluffy.   I have also doubled the recipe with equally good results.",5

I chilled the cookie dough for 30 minutes before forming the cookies and then put them in the fridge again before baking them. Maybe next time I will add more flour or use less butter.",0

1,0,0,0,100,Excellent classic dish. I double the sauce with 3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese for 7 to 9 medium potatoes. I bake at 400 for 1 hour for more browning on top.,5
1,0,8,4,275,This recipe was so good.  The sauce that you pour over the sandwiches is amazing.  I had to tweak it a little bit for picky people in my house - didn&#39;t use horshradish and substituted spicy brown mustard and used dijon.  This was delicious!  I was in a crunch for time to make these so I put them in at 350 for 20 minutes.  They were perfect!!!  Definitely would make these for a family get-together.,5
1,0,0,0,100,This cake is so delicious. The only change I made was to use 1/2 tsp vanilla plus 1/2 tsp almond extract since I love almond in chocolate.  I am not a coffee drinker and did not taste any coffee in this cake.    I took it to a potluck at church and came home with an empty plate.  The frosting sounded very familiar as I believe I made it many years ago.  It was not too sweet at all.,5

I&#39;m definitely saving and will make again with ripe bananas!,5
1,0,0,0,100,I&#39;m from the south and don&#39;t put any sugar in cornbread. So I made it without and it was really good. My mother always used some hot bacon grease in hers,4

1,0,0,0,100,"This recipe was pretty good.  I used a pound of ground beef instead of a half pound, and I left my potatoes on too high of heat for too long (I got a phone call) so they went mushy and dissolved.  Other than that it was really good, and I would recomend it to anyone who loves cheeseburgers and soup!",4
1,0,2,0,253,"This is a really good &#34;base&#34; recipe - good as is, but you can customize to come up with something that is perfect for your taste.

I always follow a recipe the first time and go from there.",5
1,0,1,1,142,"This was a very flavorful soup! I followed both the recipe and some of the other reviewers&#39; comments (mix the flour, broth and wine together and then stir into the butter). Next time, I will use the soup as a sauce for chicken breast (minus the carrots, the cubed cooked chicken and wild rice on the side), as its consistency, smoothness and delicate flavor could easily make this a great sauce for a main dish.",5

1,0,0,0,100,"This is a delicious crisp recipe, albeit rather sweet for our taste. The first time I made it I followed the recipe as directed. I now make it with half the sugar . I do squeeze fresh lemon over the apples to balance the acidity and sweetness. Next time, I plan on trying apple cider in place of the water and further cutting the sugar to1/4 c., for even more apple flavor. My husband craves this apple crisp as soon as the cooler fall weather arrives.",5

1,0,0,0,100,"This cake was moist, I&#39;ll give it that. But as far as taste goes, the flavor was very lacking. I tasted almost no chocolate, and that was after I added more cocoa than it called for. I would not make this again. To me, a chocolate cake should taste more chocolatey than this cake did.",2
1,0,1,0,193,"I made this recipe when it first came out in the Taste of Home magazine in about 1998, I think.  I may as well not show up for Christmas Day gathering if I don&#39;t have them.  ;-)  I share this recipe with everyone.  The only change, which puts it over the top for flavor is that I make home made microwave caramel instead of buying it.  It makes it irresistable!",5
1,0,0,0,280,Good one,5

1,0,0,0,100,This cake was excellent; it was just perfect  after a special roast beef dinner. I garnished with strawberries since they are my favorite.,5
1,0,4,0,329,I have made this dish for years.  I don’t like olives so I leave them out.  I love this dish because it doesn’t taste like spaghetti.  It’s just plain good,5
1,0,0,0,100,"I added some Italian Seasoning, garlic powder, salt &amp; Pepper for a bit more flavor.  I cooked my beef and vegetables in olive oil, for all I believe that all Italian dishes must have olive oil.  Also added it to the spaghetti water.  It needed about 1 1/2 cans mushroom soup and another 1/8 cup water.  I felt that it was a little dry so I willtry adding more tomatoes to it next time.  Took this to a church dinner and still got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.",5
1,0,1,0,193,Just made this for dinner and it was fantastic.  I made it in 30 minutes flat by cutting the chicken breasts thin and cooking the bacon in the microwave.  Served it over rice with a side of green beans and pillsbury biscuits...tasted great and looked good too.,5
1,0,5,2,695,"I have made this many times with mixed results.  The flavor is excellent - I only used Dutch processed cocoa, but sometimes it collapses in the middle and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  So . . .  I now make it in a bundt pan and it&#39;s 100% successful.  Whip the cream before making the frosting, but I usually just make a cream cheese frosting and whip it up well.  I often add a heaping tablespoon of espresso powder to the cake batter as well.  I love this cake - dense, smooth, and rich tasting.",5
1,0,0,1,100,Yum!!!  Added a tablespoon of brandy to the white sauce and it really brought out the flavor and creaminess.  I&#39;ve also made this where I mixed the white sauce and seafood mix and then poured it into a 9x13 over cheese ravioli - cooked at 350 until bubbly.  One of my family&#39;s favorites!,5
1,0,0,0,100,This recipe was quite easy.  Everything was mixed in one bowl so clean up was minimal.  It has a sweet and tangy flavor.  Very good.,5
1,0,4,0,659,This has been a family favorite for probably 20 years.  I don&#39;t really change anything.  The only adjustment I made is that I now use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and I use skim milk instead of whole milk just because it is what we drink.  It makes a thinner soup which is fine but the original recipe is probably better but still great flavor either way.  I also quit measuring everything.  I just add as much or as little of everything that I want.  Always good.  It&#39;s hard to screw up.,5
1,0,0,2,100,Awesome! I used chocolate chips in place of nuts. Love it!!,5

Husband says I have to make this again, which I definitely will.  I also added onions because we are big onion fans.  Excellent Recipe and is great in a time cruncher.  Thanks for posting",5
1,0,1,0,193,"Excellent - I took the advice of a previous review and added 1 TBSP of flour to the chicken onion garlic mix. I used two Jalapenos instead of the canned chilies. I had to puree the beans only because my DH doesn&#39;t like the bean texture and I used butter beans.  Lastly, I used 4 oz of cream cheese I had left in the fridge and a splash of heavy cream.  EXCELLENT.",5

I would then blend this soup so she could just swallow and still have the nourishment.  Now that she has passed, I always think of her when I make this as this was her favorite.

I substitute real heavy whipping cream for a more natural taste, and it holds up nicely.  I also use other fruits sometimes (black cherries with black cherry jello; blueberries with blueberry jello).  This is a dessert best eaten as fresh as possible, as the pretzels will start to get soft after the first day.  I typically bake my crust the day before, but wait until about 4 hours before serving to assemble.  Be sure to completely cool/chill each layer before adding the next.  Let the pretzel crust cool to room temp first!  Chill after adding the cream cheese mix.  And most importantly, let your jello mix cool before adding it to the top, otherwise it will disturb the cream cheese mix and you&#39;ll have very unattractive chunks of white in your red jello.  Also be sure that the pretzel crust is sealed off from the jello, or it will get soggy.",5

I will also substitute about a third of the mozzarella for fontina, and add parmesan to the top. And will add an Italian sausage or two to the ground beef.

Lots of ways to have fun with this easy recipe!

1,0,0,0,100,"This cake is awesome. I live at high altitude and had to make adjustments to account for that.  I decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, increased the flour to 3 cups, increased the water by adding an additional 1/3 cup  and decreased baking soda to 2 1/2 tsp.  I made cupcakes instead of cake. I usually let my batter rest for at least 15 minutes before baking. However, I made my first batch as soon as the batter was loaded and the cupcakes rose okay but spread a little.  The batter that had a chance to rest made perfect cupcakes. They rose without spreading at all.  It&#39;s important at high altitude to not fill the pans too high.  I filled them to about a half to  3/4 inch from the top and it was perfect.  Unfortunately there are no magic adjustments that you can use for every recipe.

Chili and the intensity of flavors is a personal preference... I&#39;ve modified the recipe to our family&#39;s preferences!  I will make this again!  Thanks for the great idea!",4

If you like plain food, then you&#39;d like this. But if I were to make it again, I would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure. The casserole doesn&#39;t really have any sauce to it, and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole, leaving you with 2 layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato.

Oh, and I used 4 different types of apples (Granny Smith, jazz, pink lady, and braeburn). As others have stated, the batter was indeed quite stiff, but my little Sunbeam mixer could still handle it. When it was time to stir in the apples, the fruit-to-batter ratio was very high; no wonder this cake is so incredibly moist! Speaking of which?don?t worry if the surface of your cake is hard and crusty when it comes out of the oven. After it?s mostly cooled, cover it with foil and it will resolve itself shortly to become uniformly moist and tender. As with most cakes, it&#39;s better the second day. I think the cake stands on its own without the sauce, but that punch of sweetness is a nice treat. I added a few drops of butter-rum extract, just for fun. I will make this sauce again for other things (ice cream, or a dip for apples, for example). Five stars!",5

And I increase the amounts of most everything when taking to a group...exact amounts have never seemed to be too important...the outcome is always great!

On the 1.5 cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it. This makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast. Next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or Velveeta cheese. Last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic, pressed. Put this in during sauce thickening. I sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting. He is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had. HE would not say that for fun. It&#39;s goooouooood!

You can use canned potatoes and carrots if you are crunched for time.

You really can&#39;t tell the difference and he got to enjoy a long lost treat.  I did prepare the soy butter filling ahead but only added an extra 1/2c conf. sugar because the soy butter is a little dryer than peanut butter and didn&#39;t want filling to crumble.

Read the reviews and added a couple of tbsp. of chopped crystallized ginger to the dough, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  The cookies turned out fabulously.  My daughter&#39;s classmates and teachers hoovered them up and she received three requests for the recipe.  The cookies are soft, but that coating of granulated sugar makes for a nice thin crisp glaze.  We will definitely be making these again.",5

I followed other reviewers&#39; suggestions to add a smidge more vanilla and a pinch of salt.  I did also add about 1/2 tsp. of rum extract because I thought the batter tasted good, but needed a little... something!  You could really use this cake as a base and add any type of extract or flavoring you&#39;re in the mood for.   I also agree with the others who said it&#39;s very important to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes, maybe even a little longer.  I also made sure I beat the sugar and eggs until they were nice and airy too.  35 minutes in the oven was perfect.  The cake tastes great on its own--especially when it&#39;s still warm--but I plan on serving  it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream later.  Can&#39;t wait!",5

Both families prefer simple, home-cooked foods and this was just the ticket. When I told my sister about the recipe, she reminded me that our Mom used to use crumbled saltines in her meatloaf way back when...! I only made a couple of slight variations to the recipe here. I used 2 lbs of ground round and I added about 1/3 of a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix to the recipe (something my Mom always used in meatloaf.

Did it turn out like grandmas? No. I tried this recipe last night. I used 3/4 of the all mixed, finished batter and put hat into a  loaf pan. The remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins. I did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs. This recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans. But my sister swore by this. No the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked. This was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan. I sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist. Most breads come out too dry when I use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time. My sister was right. Thanks sis! The bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this AMAZING recipe. I kept a eye on the bread after a half hour and did the tooth pick trick to see when my bread was done. Finally I have a banana bread recipe I will be excited to add to our family favs cook book!",5

It makes a huge difference, and I find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well.  I toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor, and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce (ground chicken, turkey, beef . . . even elk!) and it has come out fantastic every time.

I also used just a little garlic, only because we are both sensitive to it, but if you are not, then go for it. Im sure it would add a lot.  I didn&#39;t have sharp cheddar so i used 4 cheese Mecican blend shredded. Worked fine. But these were minor tweeks and I&#39;m sure it is fabulous just as written too. Mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin.  I did set out the 2 creams when i first started the dish so they wouldn&#39;t be so cold. When ready to add them i stirred a couple teaspoon of the hot chili into each to warm them up before adding so they wouldnt curdle. I will defimitely make this again.

I can never make a recipe without some augmentation to make it my own... mishpachah...like family, my Bubbe would say. I omitted the milk. I used a cup of homemade milk free gravy I had left from the meal for which I made the roast chicken we were using (leftovers) for this pie. I recently discovered, if done right, no milk is needed and creaminess survives! I also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid. In addition I added a Tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes. I made a homemade simple crust (ice water, butter, flour and salt) and brushed the top with yolk/water combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme. The cooking time was spot on, even here at high elevation in Colorado. I only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy, hearty, comforting goodness.

I had a few items I needed to use up in the fridge, so I added a partial red pepper &amp; green pepper in addition to the veggies listed in the recipe. I put 1/2 cup of Gorgonzola cheese and it was a perfectly flavored salad to go with our BBQ chicken.

1,0,0,1,100,I made the Apple Pie today. Came out ok. I read the other reviews several cooks said they added additional flour to thicken the mixture. I used granny smith apples so they don&#39;t produce a lot of juice so I didn&#39;t need the addition flour that is required in with more juicy apples. I did find the pie was a bit too sweet. My fault again I should have tasted my apples.,5

Will make this a normal part of our rotation. THANKS for posting!",5
1,0,1,0,193,Tastes OK but is very messy and crumblyWould not make again,1
1,0,1,0,193,I did not find this to be anything special- a macaroni salad with bacon mixed in. Never got a sense of a BLT due to the high volume of mayo ( should have followed my instincts and dropped that additional 1/4 cup) . Don&#39;t regret making but have no intentions of doing so again.,3

Someone posted about keeping this handy in the fridge, I agree 100%. Never again will I purchase teriyaki sauce.

I also add a pinch of salt.  I bake in a 9 inch pan for 25 minutes (check with a toothpick 5 minutes before the directions state - you don&#39;t want a dry cake).

I was initially worried because the rise was quicker that the recipe said (first one doubled in 50 minutes and the second in 40) and the bread was much bigger than anticipated but overall it tasted really good. Also the recipe doesnt estimate a cook time, for me it was 1 hour and 25 minutes at 190°C",5

A hint for those who are having problems with the chocolate topping cracking when trying to cut into squares.  Take the pan from the refrigerator and let it sit on your counter until the chocolate warms up a little.  The caramel will also soften some and be easier to cut.  It is a winner!,5

I mixed same amount of tapioca, as cornstarch, into apples(which can be increased along with sugar depending on pan side) along with the sugar and put the vanilla in apples too; decreased the oven temp to 325-335 and baked until apples were done.

I also used a blend of feta, sharp cheddar, and sheep cheese which made it even creamier and extremely addictive!  I also spruced it up with a few additional spices (lots of garlic!).

This recipe can make a novice cook look like a seasoned pro. It was flavorful, juicy and the two of us could have easily eaten the other two servings. :)  I will definitely be making this again.  I liked the idea shared in the reviews of sauteing the onions. I&#39;m also toying with the idea of using half chicken broth and half white wine for the sauce mixture.  To answer &#34;Lousey Cook in Texas&#39; question: I don&#39;t know that it would taste as good as making it fresh. The breading on the chicken might get a bit soggy.

1,0,8,5,686,"I think many of us take a recipe and add/change things to make it our own.  I have never had very good luck making meatloaf.  It was either way too dense or it would fall apart.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I did, however, add/change a couple of things.
A while back I ordered &#34;tomato powder&#34; from the Spice House.  I always forget that I have it.  But I saw it in the refrigerator (keeps it from getting hard as a rock), and figured I&#39;d add it in to the ground beef.  I used about a tablespoon.  I suppose you could always use a couple of tablespoons of the double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube.

I also used mostly 90/10 ground beef, but figured I&#39;d add some 80/20 in for some extra moisture (and obviously more fat).   My mom always used Ritz crackers for meatloaf or meatballs....so I combined Ritz crackers and saltines...not really sure it made a difference.  Then I added about one or two teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet to the mixture.

I&#39;m not sure if my changes made any difference at all from the original recipe, but this was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  My 29 year old son, asked me if it was any good, and I told him to taste it and let me know.  He called from the kitchen and said,   &#34;Dad, this is the BEST meatloaf!

The cookies are scrumptious but I didn’t feel they had enough ginger so I added about 1 1/2 -2 tsp of Ginger paste that was in my refrigerator ( Aldi find )  I also use thicker coarse colored sugars in a rusty red autumn color.  They have the coarse sugar at TJMax or Marshalls far cheaper than anyone. ! I took them out of my convection oven when they were soft and voila the center is soft and the outer edges are crispy!

1,0,2,0,253,"After further evaluation this recipe is bumped up to three stars. To get it right,  you must cook the dish at lower temperature for a longer duration. I found starting at 400 for 40 minutes and then dropping the temp to 300 in a convection oven for 90 minutes to be successful.  The cheese bechamel is still holding and the potatoes are cooked as far as I can tell using a toothpick to test the softness. Feel free to add your own touches to make this dish your own.

However, I found that all the jello did not get completely &#39;folded in&#39; as there were a few chewy pieces of the jello spread throughout the pie. I also found that the crust apparently absorbed some liquid from the filling as it was a little softer than I would have liked. Maybe that was because I used Dream Whip instead of Cool Whip which I did not have on hand and no time to go out and purchase some.",4

I used an 11&#34; x 8.5&#34; pan because my 9 x 13 inch pan had something in it.  Everything fit but the gelatin layer, had enough extra for four ramekins of strawberry Jell-O.  Changes I would make next time:  add  a full cup of butter to the pretzels, add a teaspoon of unflavored gelatin to the Jell-O to make it firmer (I was worried it might melt in transit), it didn&#39;t.    The ladies at church told me I could bring this again,  anytime!",5
1,0,0,0,100,We LOVED this recipe. It turned out beautiful. The only thing I did different was I didn&#39;t simmer the sauce for 60min instead I simmered it for 30min.

1,0,0,0,100,"Old yeast isn&#39;t necessarily dead.  I&#39;ve used rapid rise yeast that&#39;s close to 8 months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly.  However, if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line, that could kill it long before the expiration date.  Dissolving it in water that&#39;s too hot will do it in too.  Best to have the water 105? to 110?.  If you set it  out to rise is in a cold room, that will prevent any rising.  I warm the oven a bit before I start and turn it off after a minute or so when it&#39;s around 100?.  That seems to work well for rising.  If the dough doesn&#39;t rise even after it&#39;s set in the oven to bake, then the yeast was dead.",4
1,0,2,0,253,So easy and delicious. We like a bit of heat so I added red pepper flakes to the beef and onions and mixed in some pickled jalapenos slices to the finished mixture before baking to spice it up a bit. Will definitely make it again!,5

1,0,6,5,226,"Great basic recipe, can use as is, or adjust. Our family does like a little extra flavour in our food, so we usually add more spices than a recipe calls for. And I did add a few extras to make more soup to last longer with portions to freeze for later. Apart from the basic recipe: I added 1 can black beans, 1 diced green pepper, 1 diced white onion, 1/2 can leftover tomato soup (just to avoid wasting it.) Some cumin, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, parsley, adobo seasoning, chipotle chile powder, and about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and some more water. I added black olives to mine but not the entire pot, because a lot of people hate olives. I love them though and they are a great addition! Then we topped as desired with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crushed tortilla chips when serving. It worked out great. This recipe is versatile in how you can add to it or adjust it to make it work for you / stretch it for extra servings.

Cut into smaller pieces.), 2lbs frozen wild salad shrimp (Costco).  Using the fresh crab was well worth it, once I was done cracking it all - the flavor was amazing! I added 6-8 roasted garlic cloves to the sauce as well. My entire family loved this lasagna, including kids and some pickier people.

1,0,0,0,100,Great sweet corn bread recipe. I’ve made it twice sticking to original recipe. It does make a large amount so I froze a few pieces in freezer bags and used them during the rest of the week.  You can defrost them or they reheat well in the microwave. Just a minute or less for a couple of pieces. This recipe is very much like the Krusteaz Honey Cornbread mix I usually buy.  If you like sweet cornbread you’ll definitely want to try this.,5
1,0,0,0,100,I always use my own pastry but the filling was spot on.  This was a typical roux so am uncertain why many thought it was too much flour?  As with any roux you must cook long enough with liquid to make it a somewhat thick but creamy white sauce before adding the other ingredients so maybe that is the case.  Will definitely keep this in the &#34;wheelhouse&#34; of recipes!!,5

And didn&#39;t have any onions (because that&#39;s pandemic cooking!) so just used some onion powder for flavor.

This recipe is great as is but the additions were nice &amp; changed it up a little.  I added 1 C. frozen corn to the meat/onions in the pan.  I added 4 cloves garlic chopped to the pan towards the end of cooking.  I used 2 C. Tostitos Mild Chunky Salsa (used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great).  I used 2 cans black beans.  Used 1 C. lite sour cream which I added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer.  I used 1/2 C. Zesty Italian dressing (Kraft).  Used 8 flour tortillas instead of 6 &amp; put it all in a 9X13 baking pan.  I used 8 oz. authenic mexican cheese blend already pre-shredded &amp; more cilantro because we love it!

I seriously can’t understand how this is award winning or how some people ended up with it being runny. After adjusting the consistency of the “sauce” I was able to create a lasagna.

1,0,21,5,813,"So good!!  I saved myself a pan though in the directions - after I transferred the cooked ground beef (I used a full pound and it was perfect) to a plate, I melted all of the butter called for in the same pan, sauteed the onions, carrots and celery and then sprinkled the flour over top after the veggies had softened.  I mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth.  It smelled so good while it was cooking!!  Once the potatoes were cooked through, I added in the milk and I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta, it is what I had on hand.  I also left out the basil and the sour cream and I am glad I did - my whole family loved this and I will definitely be making it again!  It came together so fast, a very hearty soup and so easy to make!

I, too, added carrots ( 1 can, drained, cut up a little in the can before adding to soup) and finely diced onion and celery (cooked in broth until soft the night before while I was cutting up the chicken). I agree that maybe 4 cups of noodles would have been plenty. Gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because all those noodles soaked up all the broth while it was on low in the crock pot during the party ,even with my adding lots of extra broth! It was so good, I will make it again but with less noodles and not for a long-standing-time event.",4

I use 2 pounds of ground beef (or meatloaf mix; that&#39;s good, too). Otherwise, it turns out too &#34;loose&#34; for our taste. I grate the onion instead of chopping it. That way, its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf. And finally, instead of one free-form loaf in the middle of my 13&#34; x 9&#34; pyrex pan, I make two. That way, there&#39;s more surface to be covered with the sauce, and we just like it better that way. Leftovers make awesome sandwiches, too!

I also used 3-16oz cans Hunts tomato sauce and 1  6oz. can tomato paste. I used 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp. salt.  For the cheese I used a 16 oz. block of mozzarella-shredded by hand instead of the 12 oz. in the recipe.  I also added a pkg. of Kraft Italian 5-cheese finely grated to the top when it is uncovered.  I baked at 350 degrees for 60 minutes, then uncovered and baked 15 minutes more with the added cheese.  This is a very good lasagna recipe, but be sure to bake in a lasagna pan as it does not fit into a 13 X 9 pan!",5

I put about a cup in with the cream cheese only bc i had sugar free pb... Its still borderline too sweet tho.We used the butterfinger bits instead of the reeses too.And a little tip for the oreos... I used an already made oreo pie crust for that. It holds together better to spread the cream chesse on top. I just dumped it in the bottom of the casserole dish i used and sorta smashed it down to cover the whole bottom.Still ridiculously good for 10 mins of work!,5

I will be “doctoring” the leftovers as I serve it.,3
1,0,1,2,127,"This recipe has potential but some flaws that keep it from being 5 stars.  First as for taste, it is good but for my family possibly too sweet.  For clarity, I did take the advice of other reviewers and use light brown sugar instead of white which I think is essential if you want a true teriyaki flavor.  However, the sugar definitely needs to be adjusted and cut down.  Second, I also had the same problem as other reviewers in not being able to get the sauce to properly thicken as expected.  There was just too much of if and I used a little over three pounds of chicken thighs.  I served it with rice and there was PLENTY of sauce to go round and then some!  Finally, the cook time is way off.  Luckily I had read the reviews and noted this issue.  My chicken was done at 3 hours so I moved the crock-pot setting over to warm.  If you cook this the full time stated in the recipe you will get over-done dry chicken.  As I mentioned, this recipe as potential but could use some tweaking.",3

There is corn flour - which I do not believe is the correct ingredient because it clearly doesn&#39;t say &#34;corn flour.&#34; But there is also fine grind, medium grind and coarse grind - each of which will produce a  completely different result. I&#39;m a free-spirit when it comes to cooking, but baking requires a different approach. I&#39;m astounded that 144 people have had wonderful results, while I&#39;m still trying to figure out which type of cornmeal to use. I&#39;ve read all the comments and have only seen one reference to grind - Priscilla saying coarse grind may have made it grittier. (Thank you, Priscilla!)

1,0,0,0,100,"Great basic recipe that is easily adaptable to one&#39;s specific tastes. Be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe, though. The citric acid will eventually &#34;cook&#34; the chicken (in fact, this is how ceviche is made). As for freezing the chicken--yes, it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken. However, if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken, the culprit is most likely a dull knife. Of course, many of us freeze chicken, but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat. Given a choice, I would always choose &#34;never been frozen&#34; chicken, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t freeze it just to make cutting it easier.",5

I layered on some processed cheese, you know, the kind that comes in a 2# loaf, and just left it to bubble away. My husband declared it &#34;some really good comfort food&#34;, which was perfect after the crummy, rainy day we had.  So, please forgive me, reviewer purists out there. For everyone else, I&#39;ll just say this recipe is very forgiving. It&#39;s hard to go too wrong with a combo of beef, veggies and potatoes, especially when you only have to wash one pan.

1,0,1,0,193,For those having trouble with the cake not baking properly it&#39;s probably due to the fact that boxed cake mixes have gotten smaller since this recipe was first published in 2013.

I won&#39;t make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didn&#39;t set right, but I will be using the crust recipe (a 3/4 recipe) for the next pie I make.  Perhaps that will turn out better.Reserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick, so I reserved about 1 3/4 cup, which turned out nicely.  I used 2 different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in.  Unfortunately, this still didn&#39;t really give the filling any flavor.  I was amazed at how thick the water/cornstarch/sugar mixture got after boiling, but it was really jelly-like when I took it out of the oven.  I was worried that it wouldn&#39;t set as it cooled, and it didn&#39;t really.I will say though, that EVERY TOH pie recipe I read calls for a 9&#34; pie dish, but EVERY ONE I make NEEDS a 9.5&#34; Deep Dish pan.

One thing I ••didn&#39;t••do was follow the recipe to a T. when I read the ingredients it sounded way too sweet (it was going to have a cloying affect). reading all the reviews I found others thought so too after they had made it. decided to cut the powdered sugar in half. didn&#39;t add powdered sugar to the pudding either. Also a change I made was to cut some of the sweetness by adding some creme fresh  to the cream cheese. Another thing I did was melted the butter and I broke up the cookies more fine like a pie crust. I knew if I added the melted butter to the cookie crumbs I&#39;d be able to pat it better into the bottom of my container. I put it in the refrigerator overnight because I plan on serving this to my coworkers for the next few days. also omitted putting the cookie chunks and/or the minI peanut butter cups on top because I didn&#39;t know how well it would travel on a plane and the top treats would just get squashed plus seemed like overkill.my husband was able to just have one bite last night (and a small bite at that) because his stomach was on fire from Mexican restaurant  we went to for dinner. he did say this was very good. I actually think I&#39;ll make this several more times. I wish I would&#39;ve known about it last weekend at our 3yr old&#39;s birthday party but I didn&#39;t. all in all I think this is a hit.dinged a point because of original recipe being too sweet for our taste as written plus additions&amp;subtractions.PS....UPDATE: July 1stmade it again yesterday for a neighbor who is having a 1st time swim/pool filling up party tonight.

Next time, I&#39;ll try freezing some, too, and see if that works well.Be very carful not to overbake them.

1,0,0,1,100,"A pretty good recipe, but I thought it needed some help.  The mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup, but I did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product.  Solution, I pureed them once fully cooked with 1 cup of beef broth.  That is a second change I made, beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons.  For me, a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato, so that brought me to my third modification - 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices.  My fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef.  I also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup.  To keep the cooked ground beef moist &amp; tender, I did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done.  The mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup.  I used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted.  Rather than Velveeta, which contributes too much salt to the soup, I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 12 ounces of sharp cheddar (use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger).  The cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce, and made the sour cream unnecessary.  I finished with salt &amp; pepper to taste  along with a generous 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard.  After all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup (the tomatoes) and mustard?  While I made a number of changes that I prefer to this soup, I would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration.",3

1,0,0,0,100,"Thank you for posting this recipe.  I changed it a bit with fine results. Here&#39;s what I did: omitted the applesauce and used a tad less sugar, used a tad more flour(maybe a few extra tablespoons because I did not measure flour exactly), used softened butter instead of oil and baked the batter in one larger glass loaf pan instead of two smaller ones. I used whole walnuts, not chopped walnuts. Toward the end of baking (last 20 minutes) I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees. This came out the best so far out of all the gluten free recipes for banana bread I have tried.   I also used a homemade recipe for gluten free flour that contains the following:  white rice flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, pectin and xanthan gum.  The raw batter was thick going into the pan.  Once the butter and sugar were  creamed, I basically dumped everything else in including whole peeled bananas, and whipped it all up in my kitchen aid mixer for less than a minute.  I liked the sprinkled nuts on top(which I did not measure) as opposed to mixing them into the batter. I just made sure the top of the batter was covered nicely with walnuts.  The nuts get nice and toasted and it looks good, too!   By the way, there is no milk in this recipe.   Perhaps leaving out the applesauce is why the batter was not soupy.  I like to alter recipes when I don&#39;t have all the ingredients on hand.   I also like this recipe because it uses a lot of ripe bananas, which I had plenty of today  : )",5

1,0,1,0,193,"It&#39;s the easiest fudge recipe I&#39;ve ever found that produced such delicious results! I get requests from friends and family for this amazing fudge. I typically make it the night before and allow it to set overnight, then I cut it with a greased pizza cutter. I&#39;m not sure about it yielding 3-4 dozen, unless you cut the pieces very, very small. I would say more like 2 1/2 dozen would be more accurate.",5

0,0,1,0,193,I made this for St. Patrick&#39;s Day.  It is a moist cake but doesn&#39;t taste chocolatey at all. It tastes like beer.  The frosting was quite runny so I added additional powdered sugar trying to thicken it up some but it didn&#39;t work. It stayed runny even after refrigerating. It tasted good though. I poured it over the cake. My husband liked it but he loves beer.,2
1,0,0,0,100,I first tried this recipe from my Taste of Home cookbook a few years back. It has become a family favorite!! It really is easy to make and has such great flavor. I make it a few times during the year. especially during the cold winter months. I&#39;ve also tried it with jar sauce but It&#39;s just not the same  I&#39;ve also used my own homemade sauce from cooking down tomatoes which is to die for!!! I loaned my cookbook to my SIL and have not gotten it back yet so I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s included in the online recipes. My husband has been craving &#34;the best lasagna ever&#34; as he calls it. he&#39;s so right. definitely a 5 star recipe,5

I made the recipe and a half and got eight 6 to 8 inch pancakes.  I did throw in a handful of walnuts also which added a nice texture to an already delicious pancake.  Also, I didn&#39;t have quick cooking oatmeal, just the regular, and the substitution was fine.  Highly recommend these pancakes, and thanks for sharing this recipe.",5

The recipe was very simple and I was worried that it would not be very flavorful, but this was perfect.  The sauce was amazing and the cheese mixture was fantastic.  Many lasagna recipes turn out very runny, but the cheese mixture in this was just right.  I used the lasagna noodles that don&#39;t require cooking and made sure to allow the lasagna to sit on the counter for 15 minutes before cutting.  This will now be our lasagna recipe from now on!  Thank you for sharing Lorri!",5

1,0,0,0,100,"Yum! For our tastes, I omitted the yellow pepper, and grilled a couple chicken breasts on the indoor grill to replace the turkey.

Served it with shredded cheddar, tortilla chips and sour cream. Hubby loved it - even after I confessed about the pumpkin!",5
1,0,0,0,100,These were really very good and so easy!  The only change I made was to add Emeril&#39;s Southwest Seasoning to taste to the veggies when saut?ing.  Will make again.  The combination of seasonings in the marinade tasted like fajitas without a prepackaged mix.,5

1,0,0,0,100,Just okay. It&#39;s your average banana bread.,2
1,0,1,0,193,I did not need 7 dozen cookies so I used half of all ingredients except for the oats.  I used the cup the recipe called for and omitted the nuts.  I also sprinkled flake coconut on top.

Cooked the ground turkey then added the pasta sauce to it in the same pot. Followed the recipe from there &amp; sprinkled 2 tablespoons of grated Romano cheese on top.  I made this yesterday morning and left it in the fridge, brought it to room temp. 2 hours before baking.  Frankly, I rather make this than lasagna, since its easier, lighter &amp; tastier.

The cookies seem pretty sweet, I will probably try them again by the recipe and see if they are the same.  I didn&#39;t add the nuts and I thought my dough was a little dry, but the chewy factor is there.  They don&#39;t flatten much so I kind of pushed them down when they came out of the oven.  It&#39;s a keeper for sure.",4

1,0,0,0,100,"Hello everyone, I am not a pro in the kitchen but love to try recipes and eat food. I followed this recipe exactly as above. The amount of water seems problematic to me, I put the amount indicated and the bater became so watery, but decided to give it a shot. After 35 minutes of baking the cake was still SUPER watery, so I put it an other 10 minutes, and still watery. It ended up staying in the oven for more than an hour until a toothpick came out clean. The cake came out actually kind of dry instead of moist. Can someone tell me what I did wrong?",0
1,0,0,0,100,"Just looking at the recipe, the 3 cups of sour cream seemed overdone. So, I reduced the sour cream to 16 oz, used only 1/2 pound bacon, omitted the extra salt, and reduced the amount of cheese, though I didn&#39;t really measure that.  I had less than 1 c. of mozzerella, so I sprinkled on some grated parmesan. My 1.75 lbs of potatoes seemed a little scant, even in my smaller oval casserole, so I&#39;m really glad I had decided to reduce the other ingredients.But, overall, it was very tasty and I will definitely be adding it to my potato dish rotation (with my changes, of course).",4

To save prep time I use 16 oz frozen diced potatoes and 16 oz frozen mixed veggies. I also decreases the thyme to 1/2 tsp.  I do end up making 3 pies using these amounts. Lately my kids have decided they don&#39;t like the crust as much so I only put crust on the top.  It&#39;s definitely time consuming to make, but having 2 spare in the freezer makes it worth it. Plus I love it so much!! The reheat from frozen instructions are spot on. If you haven&#39;t tried this, you are missing out!",5
1,0,0,0,100,I agree with Christine ... picnic and folks will rip the bowl out of your hands.,4
1,0,1,1,142,Excellent!  I always cut the sugar in half and add a smidgen of stevia leaf powder in order to trim calories and fat from recipes; especially from sugar filled desserts. My bananas were small so I used 3 and mashing them gave me a bit more than a cup.  I also use a non-egg egg replacer because of allergies to eggs.  Some recipes don&#39;t turn out as well using egg replacer but this one turned out beautifully!  I also use an icing sugar made with tapioca flour; due to allergies.  I used half the icing sugar and added about 1/2 cup tapioca flour to help with the volume and DID NOT add in any stevia.  There was still enough frosting to cover the bars and it was still plenty sweet.  Some reviews mentioned that the recipe didn&#39;t make 4 dozen but it does!  I cut into 6 rows (10 inch side) by 8 rows (15 inch side).  They were the perfect size!  I took them to a large gathering and received many compliments on them.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!,5

1,0,7,2,303,"Super fantastic.   My hubby needed something hearty but liquid and this did the trick.    I did read through the comments and did some changes.   First I started with crimini mushrooms.   When the onions and mushrooms were cooked I added crushed roasted garlic and dried thyme.   I also added a splash (1/4 cup) of sherry to the broth.    Let it boil for about 15min then added whipping cream, some more butter,  another &#34;splash&#34; of sherry and some fresh lemon juice.   Shimmered for about 1/2hr.  Pulled out a 1/2 cup of mushrooms,  then used the immersion blender to what it was in the pot.   Added back the mushrooms set aside.   Did add just a little cornstarch to thicken it a little bit more.   The extra cooking allowed the flavor to developed.  Definitely a keeper recipe.",5

I was still skeptical even as I mixed the packets together to pour over the meat. But one taste put all skepticism to rest. I made gravy from the juices and it was delicious.

10,0,2,0,253,I don&#39;t  give 5 stars very often. But my husband and I really did like this a lot. My teenage boys thought it was fine but they don&#39;t like Mexican food that much. I used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section. Traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has WAY too much salt. I also didn&#39;t add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested. The salt flavor was perfect. My husband also bought the HUGE tortillas so I still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla. I used 7 tortillas but they I cut about 1/3 off of them. I put in a little over 1/2 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top. We loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top. I wish I put avocado on top too. The flavor was great. There was a ton of sauce and we love sauce. Great meal.,5
1,0,2,0,253,This soup has become a family favorite and we have never added the sour cream.  We just usually never have it on-hand.  We use left-over rotisserie chicken that&#39;s been shredded and regular curly noodles. I think half the amount works good as they do swell up and absorb a lot of the liquid. One of these days we will try with egg noodles and sour cream but it is still delicious. My family calls it &#34;the good soup&#34;. I will definitely keep this recipe.,5

I didn&#39;t use salt, but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour.  Then squeezed it through paper towels.  I really wanted a firm crust so baked it for 25 minutes rather than 20.  That timing was absolutely perfect; the edges were just starting to brown.  I added garlic, red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce, and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking.  The ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than I had expected, and the zucchinie was less.  This is a great casserole in which to &#34;hide&#34; vegetables.

My husband loved it and I tweaked it a bit....sauteed the onions and carrots in the bacon grease for added flavor, increased the amount of veggies by 25% and the broth by 50%, used half and half instead of milk, used minced celery (had no celery seed and trying to keep sodium low), added a tsp garlic powder, and lastly..... added 1/3 c mozzarella to tone down the velveeta twang. It was so creamy with soft chunks of potato - exceptional flavor (may try without bacon or half and half  next time due to heart health issues - any suggestions to replace the bacon?)  and it made enough for multiple additional meals which I plan to take the advice from others for various add-ons.

Based on other reviews, I added a whole chopped onion &amp; 3 cloves of garlic to the ground beef as it browned.  I used 1.5 Quarts of reduced sodium beef broth and brown long grain rice.  I also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and added 1 tablespoon of dried basil and 1 teaspoon each of dried rosemary and thyme.  We topped it with shredded extra sharp cheddar and had crusty French bread on the side.  It was extremely filling and fairly healthy.  I used 93/7 lean ground beef, and with the additional spices, we found it very flavorful.  I hope it will reheat well as my freezer is stocked full of it.",5

1,0,0,0,100,Just made these yesterday.  My daughter and I ate one right out of the oven and they tasted like a slice of pumpkin pie!!  I did add the frosting and cut it in half per peoples suggestion and it was perfect.  They  made exactly 24 cupcakes.  I used my pampered chef cookie scoop (medium one) and it worked really well because the batter is kind of...puffy or frothy.  Sooo yummy.  My hubby thought the frosting was a little too overpowering.  He couldn&#39;t tell they were pumpkin cupcakes till i told him.  But still loved them.,5
1,0,1,0,193,"I thought  I would love it, but it was too soupy and spicy with no pumpkin taste. If I were to make it again, I would another can of pumpkin , one less can of tomato and one less cup of broth. I would use ground turkey and no oregano.",2

I may add more coconut too.  Thank you for the recipe.",0

I made some changes but am sure the original recipe is just as good. I reserved a few tablespoons of bacon grease and sauteed finely chopped onion, garlic and three celery stalks until tender.  I used reduced sodium broth and bacon and increased amount of salt to 1 rounded tsp.    I also reserved some of the bacon for garnish with shredded cheese.  I used 1 can evaporated milk and half-half to equal 2 cups and then used 1 cup 1% milk to equal the 3 cups recipe calls for.  I  purchased cream of potato in case i needed to thicken but no thickening needed.  It was so creamy and literally &#34;hugged&#34; the spoon, I think the evaporated milk helped. Next time I will add another cup of potatoes. Thanks so much for the recipe!",5

I used smoked turkey breast that my husband made over the holidays instead of the chicken.  I also used  2 fresh garlic cloves (minced) and did not saute the meat, onion and garlic.  I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano and white pepper for the pepper.  Last of all, I just dumped everything in the crock pot (set on high) for about 3 1/2 hours, adding the sour cream and cream the last half hour.  DELICIOUS!!!!",5
1,0,1,0,193,Easy to prepare and really enjoyed the taste and texture.  I added ham cubes and parsle instead of bacon.

Will be part of my &#34;Family&#34; recipe cookbook!,5
1,0,0,0,100,"This recipe is really good, and a great summer dish for when zucchinis are in abundance.  I loved the zucchini crust.  It was such a nice change of pace to a heavy bread crust.  The only changes I made were based on using ingredients on hand - used an Italian cheese blend for the mozzarella and a colby-jack blend for the cheddar because I had both of those.  I love a dish that is versatile in that way so just use whatever cheese combo you like best on this dish and you should have a winner.  Also, I took the advice of others and cooked the bell pepper with the beef and onions because my family prefers that combo.  My skeptical pizza loving daughter ate this and said it was good.  I will definitely be making this dish again.",5
1,0,0,0,100,"Why did I wait so long to try this. Excellent recipe as is, but I tweaked just a tad. I doubled the meat and added a little crumbled bacon (I like bacon cheeseburgers). I subbed extra sharp cheddar for the Velveeta because I always have it and never have Velveeta. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream (I didn&#39;t want to buy a whole carton of sour cream and a single serving of the yogurt worked perfectly). Thank you, Joanie Shawhan!",5

I have tried to do that here.   I substituted chicken for the beef, margarine for the butter, used a no-salt version of chicken broth, cornstarch for the flour, tofu for the Velveeta, skim milk instead of whole, did not add any salt, and used cultured buttermilk instead of sour cream.  My family has decided that I can have it all to myself.  It&#39;s their loss.  Thank you for this recipe.",5

Not sure with the thyme I really needed it in this one. Also, needed bit more broth than stated or sauce gets to dry. Great dish! Update: On the warm up with leftovers did get very dry, if left overs next time will add a can of cream chicken soup, or make more roux. Still delicious even dry!",5
1,0,0,0,100,"I made this on the stove top, since I was getting dinner started late. Used diced cooked chicken instead of the turkey, because I always have it on hand in the freezer. Used a full quart of chicken broth (4 cups) instead of the 3 cups called for, because I like more volume. And for the diced tomatoes, I used Del Monte diced tomatoes and zesty jalapenos because my husband and I like spicy. It turned out great!! Definitely a keeper.",5

It is an exceptionally easy recipe to make, the cupcakes were delicious and the icing was good also. If you wish to speed the icing process up a bit you can place the cooked part in ice and use an electric mixer. This way you can get to the finished product sooner.

30,0,1,0,193,"What a wonderful cake!  Easy to make and just delicious!  The addition of fresh strawberries in the batter added so much fresh flavor, and the strawberry buttercream frosting is just wonderful.  This cake is moist, delicious and packed with strawberry goodness.  Its a perfect warm weather dessert when strawberries are at their peak and something I will definitely make again and again!",5
1,0,0,0,100,This is my favorite banana muffin recipe because I don&#39;t have to deal with shortening or butter!  I do add about 1 T of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and accidentally added a second egg --- the muffins were super moist.  I only needed about 17 minutes of baking and they were pretty dark on the outside (still looked good but not that golden color).  That could just mean my oven isn&#39;t accurate (entirely possible).,5

1,0,0,0,100,I liked this because I felt it was a little different than the typical baked spaghetti casserole.  My boyfriend said he would have liked it better with more tomatoes.  I personally like the cream of mushroom sauce on the top and wouldn&#39;t change it if it were for just me.,4

1,0,0,0,100,"I let my shredded &amp; salted zucchini sit for about 20 minutes, then squeezed as much of the liquid out as I could by handfuls since I felt I would be able to get more out that way. After I pressed it into the dish I used several paper towels to soak up excess liquid. After baking the zucchini was still a little &#34;liquidy&#34;, but not bad. I&#39;m wondering how it would be with 1 egg instead. With the 2 eggs it didn&#39;t seem to bind the zucchini, in fact it seems the cheese would do a good enough job.I used spaghetti sauce and added a little more garlic and a very small sprinkling of oregano and basil.",4

I made it in 13x9 pan because I had to travel with it and didn&#39;t want to worry about it falling over.  the strawberries at the store weren&#39;t looking that good right now so I used canned cherry pie filling, which was great.  I just drizzled the ganache over the top of the cherries .  I&#39;ll make it again with strawberries when they&#39;re looking better.  the frosting was great. for those of you who complained about the butter, you should try it-it&#39;s very good.  The one I made today was for a party at work and I&#39;m making another one tomorrow to take for Christmas eve dinner.",5

To keep the cake tender, go easy on the mixing and get the cake in the oven as soon as the mixing is complete.",5

The printed recipe says it makes 12 rolls, but it calls for an 18 oz package of rolls, an 18 ounce package of rolls has 18 rolls.  So, it looks like the video is showing a 12 oz package of rolls, with 12 rolls in a square pan, but the printed recipe calls for 18 rolls, but says it makes 12.  SO, wondering if this can be fixed.  I did make 18 rolls, and I did 1 1/2 times the other ingredients. Regardless, this is good!",5

1,0,1,0,193,Delicious!  Most of the time I don&#39;t add the frosting which allows me to eat more without the added calories.  Also add extra cinnamon and will try the suggestion of using Splenda.,5
1,0,0,0,488,I definitely don’t recommend this recipe without some serious tweaking. The ratio of potatoes/bacon to sour cream/cheese is ridiculous. This might be good if you doubled the potatoes and halved the dairy or added a ton of other ingredients to cut down on the richness but otherwise it’s nearly inedible. I made it entirely as directed. Total bust.,1
1,0,0,0,100,"This is a fabulous way to use up extra zucchini!!  I double the meat/tomato mixture as my husband and boys needed a meatier dish.  I didn&#39;t have italian tomato sauce and have found that one big can of Hunt&#39;s Spaghetti sauce is perfect for the doubled mixture.  I agree, it is even better the next day.",5

Now I can usually freeze one for later--unless some of my sons find out I&#39;m making this &amp; decide to come home for supper that night!  I substitute 2 cups of frozen corn for the peas as my husband hates most vegetables.  I&#39;ve also made it with only the potatoes &amp; onions.  And, I use 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning instead of thyme because I don&#39;t like the flavor of thyme.  My youngest daughter made it on her own for her 13th birthday because I only had the use of one arm at that time--I talked her through it &amp; she was very proud of the compliments she received!",5

1,0,0,2,100,Served this for guests and everyone enjoyed it. I used hot turkey sausage instead of bacon and Monterey Jack cheese instead of Swiss. I seasoned the eggs and threw in some red bell pepper because I had it on hand. I made it the day before and did not thaw the hash browns per another reviewer&#39;s suggestion. Worked great. Next time I&#39;ll add some diced green chiles or hot peppers to spice it up a bit more.  Really good!,5

I also used sausage instead of hamburger and added pepperoni because I love it. I&#39;m thinking of just baking and freezing the zucchini crust, then adding the topping when I&#39;m ready to make it. I have so MANY zucchinis. I figure I can store those easier in the freezer than the whole casserole...because we will be eating this a lot, I can tell:)",5

My only complaint is that it was way too salty and I did not even add all the salt called for and I also used low sodium beef broth. So my suggestion is to completely omit the salt. I also think this would be great with shredded chicken or beef, and with other things added to the filling like rice, beans or pickled jalapenos. I had enough filling for 13 of the 6 inch tacos. I bet you could also use corn tortillas instead of flour if you wish. Over all this was amazing and I will definitely make it again!

1,0,1,0,193,". To avoid issues that some people had you MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO KITCHEN TIPS LISTED &amp; DETAILS1)  Cool crust COMPLETELY.( I CHILL THE CRUST after it has cooled a bit on counter) Be sure to spread the cream cheese layer ALL THE WAY TO OUTER EDGES, so that it is touching the edges of the pan.(then chill)..This avoids letting the jello topping  seep down into the crust DO NOT cut the amount of sugar IN THE CRUST.PART of recipe.It is needed to make it crispy.To speed up the jello portion I dissolve the sugar ( 1/2 C. to 2/3 Cup  NOT 1 full cup) into ONLY 1 CUP BOILING WATER....Then when sugar is FULLY DISSOLVED I add in the remaining  1 Cup VERY COLD water ( OR  COLD juice) drained off from thawed strawberries to equal1 cup ) Be very sure the jello is partially set before spooning evenly over CHILLED cream cheese  layerYou do not want the jello fully set BUT you DO NOT  want it to be a pourable liquid either. IF  the jello fully sets before you get to it...just warm SLIGHTLY for a FEW SECONDS AT A TIME in the microwave till it is SEMI SET. BT not warm. Sometimes I grate some dark chocolate over the whipped cream garnish dallops, before adding the pretzel garnish....If I remember to pick up some chocolate  covered pretzels for the garnish,Good recipe but the directions could include more specific details and the sugar in the jello could be cut down to 2/3 cup....maybe even 1/2 C. especially if the frozen strawberries are sweetened type..",4

The first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave, starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110-115 deg f., then add yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar.  While mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f. then turn off and allow to cool slightly, then put the dough in there to raise (door closed). I use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans I covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking.

This really does make a lot, so I suggest that you use a nice deep lasagna pan. I made some simple additions to suit our tastes: a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat, a 10 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms (drained), and I increased the sausage to one pound. I also increased the tomato sauce to 30 ounces. Extra mozzarella on every layer. Perfecto! Helpful hints: Add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesn&#39;t stick to the foil. And in response to several questions about the sausage, recommendations are to use ground Italian sausage, NOT pork breakfast sausage or sausage links. I made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time I made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it. Yikes",5

I&#39;m very picky with my banana breads (True story!).  This is ALWAYS my GO-TO recipe to give away as treats to family/friends or to make and keep at home (but it doesn&#39;t last very long!). I&#39;ve made it exactly the way it shows in the recipe. And it&#39;s AMAZING!! However… Being the curious and advanced chef/baker that I am,  I changed a few ingredients to &#34;health&#34; it up a bit.  You&#39;re welcome to adopt my style! Here&#39;s what I did:Used 1 cup unbleached flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat( i&#39;ve also used gluten free flour blend and it works just as well )Used 1/2 cup white or raw organic sugar, 1/2 cup brownUsed 1/2 cup avocado oil instead of veg or canola (no taste diff and SO MUCH healthier!)Made my own buttermilk (1/2 cup milk with 1/2 tablespoon vinegar. Stir and  Let sit 5 mins. Discard a bit to give just over 1/4 cup.Mix well. Stir in mini chocolate chips (or 60% dark chunks) and poof!! Magic!

It ruined the soup for me and I had to dump it as did one of the other reviewers.

I followed suggestions to not have a pasty taste by decreasing the flour and increasing the milk, but it was still a bit too thick and pasty for my taste.  I did increase the macaroni to almost double, so that made a difference, but there was an unbelievable amount of sauce.

If you use a 15x10 pan it&#39;s a bar andmight want to check prior to the bake time stated.  9x13 pan is a cake&amp; will take longer to bake since it&#39;s thicker.

While that was nhappening I made a roux out of butter (I used 4 T instead of the 2) and flour, milk, melted in the cheese.

1,0,0,0,100,This bread turned out really yummy.  Took advise of other reviewers and cut cooking time to 50 minutes.  Also covered the loaf pan with aluminum foil during the last ten minutes to ensure the top didn&#39;t brown too much.  Unlike one other reviewer I thought the lemon flavor really came through.  I did increase the blueberries to 1 1/2 cup and cut the sugar to 2/3 cup.,4

1,0,0,0,100,Got lots of compliments on this cake. Like eating chocolate covered strawberries. Best to let the frosted cake set up/chill in the refrigerator before adding strawberries and ganache and then keep refrigerated until ready to serve.

I&#39;m making it tonight for a co-worker&#39;s birthday tomorrow. One little tip - wrap your cakes in saran wrap, then reynolds wrap and freeze until firm.  This really helps in making the cake easy to trip and frost.  Such a beautiful and scrumptious case! I don&#39;t mind the time involved whatsoever.",5

1,0,0,0,100,"I just made this bread and it turned out marvelous! However, I feel like it has some important steps left out that you need to know if you&#39;re not an experienced bread Baker. First of all - to activate your yeast - you need to put the warm water and yeast and sugar alone in your bowl. Stir it well, cover it, and set it aside when it&#39;s frothy looking - those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go. THEN add all the other ingredients. Otherwise it&#39;s a great basic recipe. Make sure to work the dough long enough - I do half with a dough hook and my KitchenAid and half by hand on a flour dusted counter. It needs to feel really smooth and stretchy. Good luck! It tastes delicious and a perfect texture!",5

I love the ease that this comes together-one pot, chop an onion &amp; garlic and toss everything else in.  It was finished so quickly too..a little parmesan adds salt and creaminess that makes it just perfect.  Yummo.",5

I&#39;ve been looking for lots of recipes with lemons in them, and stumbled upon this one yesterday after I received an abundance of fresh lemons and grapefruits from someone in Arizona.

1,0,0,0,100,"**something changed. I came back here to get a reminder of how to make it, and half-and-half is on the recipe. Doubted my memory and used the half and half. It was so unremarkably bland and THIN. Heavy Cream makes all the difference in the world. Possibly this recipe was tweaked since I saved it? Would rate it 3 stars as-is. Fine for a way to use up mushrooms, but nothing I would serve for a special meal. Use the original heavy cream if you want 5 stars.(previous review) I am trying to let the soup finish cooking, but can&#39;t help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove. I think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right. The mushrooms can&#39;t be plain white mushrooms. Their flavor is half the taste. I used Crimean but would have loved to use portabella/baby bellas. I also used sweet onions. (Peruvian) I cannot imagine using white or yellow with this. admittedly I fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole, and it has plenty of onion flavor in it. Also, at the suggestion of a friend, I added a roux. Accidently made it very dark, but the toasted flavor was perfect. my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so I omitted salt and pepper. Simply amazing.",3
1,1,20,2,870,I followed exactly. I found the sauce to acidic from the tomato paste so I added more sugar and adjusted seasonings. There was plenty of meat sauce and so my 9x13 pan was filled to the top as described. I did use no boil noodles with excellent results.  The recipe turned out delicious. Why others didn&#39;t like it is just personal opinion. The recipe is a keeper.,5

I couldn&#39;t get the ganache to harden so I just dripped it over the strawberries and down the sides of the cake.

The prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes, onions and carrots, count on prep time of  at least  1 1/2  hours.   If you buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco or another store , you   need to buy two chickens   for this recipe.  This recipe makes 2 LARGE pies.  It&#39;s enough, supposedly, to feed 16 people, but realistically 2 pies will feed about 8-10 adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie!  We are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie... it&#39;s so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner.

1,0,9,1,368,I&#39;ll never understand why people insist on changing things about the recipe then rating it especially giving it a bad rating.  You didn&#39;t technically make the recipe so don&#39;t rate it.   That being said this chili/soup is awesome just as it is.   I make it multiple times throughout the fall and winter.  I freese it in single.swvings in ziplocks and have a ready to heat and eat lunch.  The pumpkin gives it a richness without tasting pumpkiny.   Just the right amount of spice.,5

1,0,0,0,100,This is great anyway but after making it at least 20 times now i have some suggestions. Add an extra can of great N. beans and thicken the soup with some cornstarch or flour. Use Tillamook brand sour cream there is a HUGE difference. Iv&#39;e tried both.,5

1,0,1,0,193,"Very good and easy to make.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup , added 1/2 tsp baking powder, and omitted the almond extract.  I have made these cherry bars in the past with powdered sugar sprinkled on top, but the hint of glaze was even better!",5
1,0,0,0,100,The flavor in this was very good.  It is easy to double for a large kettle.  I found it slightly soupy for my taste but I added some mashed potato flakes and it was great.  The leftovers made a great base for green chili chicken enchiladas.,4

1,0,0,1,100,"I liked the fact that it was small.  As for the recipe, I cut the water in half and used half white @ half brow sugar with the peaches.  I wild have liked the top to have been more crisp.",3
1,0,1,0,193,Love this recipe.  It&#39;s the best cornbread I have had.  It&#39;s better than the one they sell at Whole Foods.  Most of the cornbreads I have had are dry.  This won is kind of sweet and you can cut down on the sugar.  I also used skim milk.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"We made this chicken for a taco bar for a friends rehearsal dinner.  We left out the corn and chili powder to help it appeal to even the pickiest guests. It was moist and delicious, with just the right amount of lime flavor coming through. I used Jack&#39;s (Garden Fresh) fresh salsa and I think that boosted the flavor compared to jarred chunky salsa. This is a keeper. The leftovers freeze great as well.",5

1,0,12,3,730,"When I was in middle school, I found this recipe and, subsequently, used to make it every year. When I found out I had a gluten allergy, I had to stop making them (they didn&#39;t have good gf flours then). However, this year when planning cookie gifts for Christmas, I remembered these cookies and found this online version of the recipe. I LOVE these cookies and so does anyone who I make them for! 
This time, to avoid my hands getting so sticky from shaping the balls, I took out about a tablespoon of dough and threw it into my sugar bowl and coated it with sugar and then shaped the ball. This really helped speed up the process and my hands didn&#39;t get so messy. 
Also, I recommend taking the cookies off of the pan almost immediately. With the last pan, I didn&#39;t do this immediately and the cookies collapsed slightly.",5
1,0,0,0,100,A true favorite of my husbands! He loves the sauce.,5
1,0,0,0,100,"My family LOVES this.  I have to double the recipe, and it helps the diabetic&#39;s blood sugar, too.  You can chop ahead and freeze the onion, celery and green peppers, and use prepared minced garlic (1 clove = 1 gently rounded teaspoon.)  Freezes and reheats a treat.",5

10,0,0,0,100,This is excellent.  Easy quick and l&#39;m sure it will be even more flavourful tomorrow.  Great make ahead dish.  I could not bring myself to put sugar in so I didn&#39;t.  I used home canned tomatoes so 2 32 oz. jars.  I mostly cooked the rice then let it sit and cool awhile so it would not turn to mush and must admit l remembered wrong and added 3 cups of rice.  Also l put a dollop of sour cream on each bowl before the garnish.   Great recipe.   Janet. VFE,5

0,0,0,0,100,I just made this amazing bread and it tastes great!  I only needed 5.5 cups of flour and it still came out quite dense.  I baked in the oven one level up from the bottom with a cookie sheet on the bottom level.  This keeps the bottom from getting too burnt.It came out looking exactly like the picture.  My kids love it too!  This is great cause I hate breadmakers since the belt eventually slips on them and they make more noise.  Now I can make bread with no preservatives!,5

1,0,2,0,253,"I have made these many times since they appeared in the Taste of Home magazine.  They are quick, easy and never fail.  I will advise measuring the interior of your pan.  I have two pans sold as 15x10.  One measures 15x10 on the interior and one measures 15x10 on the exterior which makes it smaller.  I like to use my (larger) 15x10 pan and increase the butter and sugar to 1 cup each.",5
1,0,0,0,100,This is perfect!!! The only thing I changed it double the ginger and used all spice insted of cloves.  Ourfriends kept saying This is a perfect taste to make a gingerbread house with.  AOH and we rolled them in colored sugar insted of white sugar and he kids went crazy for them!!!,5

Cut back on the Baking Soda!  2nd time I only used 1-1/4tsp and it rose perfectly!   And Don&#39;t use the wisk when adding in flour and baking soda.  use a spoon and stir just until everything is all wet.I also like to give a bit of spice to my Cream Cheese frosting, add in some good cinnamon and ground ginger to give it a bit of extra kick.

The recipe still worked just fine with half the butter.  We also prefer a bit more seasoning, so I added a teaspoon of my poultry seasoning and some ground cayenne pepper, and snuck in a handful of julienned kale for a little extra nutrition. I&#39;m sure the seasoning in the recipe would be just fine as is though for most families.  The amount of filling this makes is plentiful - easily enough for two deep dish pie plates, but one could probably even do 3 shallow pie dishes.

WIn-Win!!!I added a ricotta mix to make this dish like a lasagna. To my ricotta I like to add chili powder, egg, garlic powder, salt, fresh cilantro, and black pepper.  I think the chili powder help to bring out the flavor to the whole dish b/c it is a creamy dish.I did add fresh chopped garlic  when I cooked the green onions - BUT I also added and cooked 1 diced white onion tooI doubled the creamy mix b/c  I used the no boil lasagna noodles and I felt the ratio of the seafood: shrimp (cut into 3 pieces if using large shrimp (1lb), scallops (1lb), and claw crab meat (1lb) would have needed the extra sauceI did not expect to make 2, but I did.  One dish had 4 noodle layers and my other dish just had 3 noodle layers.I did noodle, ricotta, mozzarella and parmesean cheese layer, followed by seafood sauce. Then repeat the layers.  Be sure to reserve just a cup of sauce (without the seafood) for the top last layer of the lasagna. I did top that with Mozzarella too.  I didn&#39;t reserve sauce for my 2nd dish top noodle, so it was covered with the seafood. I didn&#39;t want it to burn, so that one had extra mozzarella cheese on it.Yes this is a heart attack waiting to happen, but if you are going for it, then go for it.  I wouldn&#39;t make this everyday, maybe special occasions.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made it for a potluck.  It is a little time consuming, but oh so good!!! The other dish I gave pieces away.

1,0,2,1,193,"This is my first time baking an apple pie and I used store-bought crust. I combined this recipe with a recipe from Martha Stewart and I used bits of both. I had heard about cornstarch being a great thickener instead of flour and I&#39;ve been experimenting with it lately. It&#39;s a great way to make sure it doesn&#39;t come out watery. I used extra sugar and just under 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I didn&#39;t even need to use the entire thing (spices (sea salt, ginger, nutmeg,  cinnamon, white sugar)and cornstarch mixture) . I noticed a lot of complaining in the comments about undercooked apples so I cooked everything together first and the cornstarch did its job to create a thick sauce right from the get-go. It just finished baking so I&#39;m at the cooling stage now. I added milk, cream and sugar to my egg wash and used it on the bottom crust to help keep it from being soggy as well as Heating a baking sheet for it to cook on. I&#39;ll edit if I remember!

I will definitely make this again!,5
1,0,1,0,193,Wonderful Recipe!  I made a 13 * 9  and baked it about 26 minutes.  The only change I made was to the frosting. I used mashed strawberries In a heavy syrup instead of crushed fresh strawberries. I wanted more strawberry flavor and this was perfect.  Creamed the butter and a tablespoon of the strawberries then beat in powdered sugar.  Added small amounts of strawberries until i got the  right consistency desired.  Served the cake with a really good vanilla ice cream and dribbled a little of the remaining strawberry syrup concoction over the top. People made themselves miserable with second servings.,5

I used black walnuts, but any nut of choice, or no nuts, would be just as good.  The baking time stated is a bit long for my oven, I would suggest testing before the stated baking time. Mine baked in an hour.  I always remove breads while still warm, not hot, allowing a bread to completely cool sometimes increases sticking.  Cutting a piece of waxed paper the size of the pan bottom eliminates the risk of sticking, although I didn&#39;t do it this time and had no problems.",5

1,0,0,0,100,This cake sounds wonderful will be trying it soon.i wouldn&#39;t think the shortening would make the frosting not taste good because a lot  of butter creams are half shortening half butter as in decorating cakes and reading the frosting recipe I would think either sugar would work I do know cheap shortening does not work as well and you don&#39;t want it to be more than a couple of months old.  But as others have said regarding frosting you really need to beat it good You can almost burn up a hand mixer trying to beat it sometimes. Thanks for sharing,5

The second time I added 2 tablespoons of ground ginger opposed to 2tsp because I really love Ginger.  I felt that the first batch had too much of the clove flavor and not enough of the ginger.  I used Wakaya pink Fijian ginger which is a high impact ginger, mainly to add a more healthy twist on this delicious recipe. I did not change the amount of cloves. This is now quite possibly the best tasting cookie I&#39;ve ever had.  My wife is a big Baker and she thinks that they&#39;re possibly the best cookie she&#39;s ever had.",5

I didn&#39;t have celery salt the first time I made it, so I used 3/4 tsp celery seed and increased the seasoned salt to 1 tsp. It worked out well, so that&#39;s what I continue to do.

I was excited to try this recipe based on the many awesome reviews &amp; boy were they spot on!  I did chop the nuts pretty small, as I don&#39;t really care for giant nuts in bread.  Next time though I&#39;ll make an exception and leave them a bit bigger, by request of my dad who loves the walnuts and appreciates my grandpa&#39;s hard work! ;)  I did leave three muffins without nuts just to see the difference and enjoyed them both ways.  I followed a few suggestions from other bakers; I only put in a cup of sugar (3/4 regular and 1/4 brown), I put in three bananas and I added cinnamon (a lot because it&#39;s my favorite!) and I thought they came out great!

I went about 32 minutes until the internal temp was between 180 and 190.  Immediately after they came out, I brushed the tops with olive oil. It really softened it up, but still has just enough of that homemade crunch.

It is seasoned with 1/4 teaspoon onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder.  My husband likes it this way, because he does not care for bland food.

I am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except for...then lists a long list of modifications. Well, I made some changes, too, and the outcome was great. I followed the process instructions as written. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef as I wanted a little zippier flavor, more pizza-like. I also added 1 tsp. of minced garlic after the sausage-onion mixture was browned (who doesn&#39;t like a little garlic in pizza?) My grocery store did not have Italian tomato sauce so I used regular and added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. Since the recipe called for either red or green pepper, I used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper, giving the dish a colorful look. My husband was a bit skeptical until the first bite--then he was a convert. He raved about it and I do have to say, it was delicious. I  had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bake-one-freeze-one.

1,0,0,0,100,So so good!!  We spiced it up by using Italian sausage instead of hamburger and made it thick by using 2 cups uncooked rice instead of cooked rice.  Plenty of liquid in the original recipe to allow the rice to cook up well!!,5

1,0,0,0,100,"For me, a published recipe is a guideline rather than an absolute. I adjusted this recipe slightly, based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I added 1/2 t. poultry seasoning (in place of Oregano). Used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I only had one can of chopped green chilies, so added a cup of chopped red, yellow and orange bell pepper. We like heat, so I used 1T of cayenne, and we added sliced jalape?o peppers and shredded cheese on top, forgoing the sour cream.  I used 2 c. of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and 2 T corn starch as a thickener.  There are so many ways to make white chili, that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning, based on the preferences of those you are feeding, you&#39;ve got a hit every time.  Our side was a handful of gluten free corn chips, but sweet cornbread would be perfect too.",5

1,1,47,70,640,"This recipe is a good starting point, but I made 2 modifications (one immediate, one on my second try) in order to make it a really good dish.


<ol><li>I skipped the butter the second time, instead bringing the milk to a simmer and adding the flour to thicken it. When I used the butter, I got quite a bit of excess grease sitting in the corners of the pan. I know butter is a key component of a béchamel sauce, which is the base of this dish, but you&#39;re adding enough cheese that you don&#39;t need the richness butter provides, and if it cooks out and forms a layer of grease it&#39;s not adding to the recipe anyway.</li><li>1/8 tsp of black pepper is an insultingly small amount for a recipe this large. If you use that little pepper in your cooking, please never invite me to dinner. I know the recipe says &#34;additional pepper optional,&#34; but it really isn&#39;t. This recipe makes 8 servings. 1/64th of a teaspoon per serving might as well be nothing.</li></ol>",5

After reading some of these reviews, it&#39;s always left up to a person&#39;s personal tastes. The dressing is supposed to be a bit thick so it sticks to the grapes and doesn&#39;t leave a runny mess at the bottom. Makes for a great salad in the summer on a hot day.",5

It should make a fizzing noise and then the baking powder will begin to fizz and the water will become very cloudy with tiny bubbles.

My son used it over the next few days with leftovers and with other things he made for himself.  It&#39;s very good teriyaki sauce.

1,0,0,0,100,"this is for toothfairylin. The answer to your question is.. are you using cheese that is already shredded? I found this out the hard way when I was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese. If you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesn&#39;t stick together. Also you don&#34;t really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store. So freshness does matter. It is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself. Since I have been doing that, all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly. I got this tip from Paula Dean. It was a question she answered from her cooking magazine. I hope this helped you.",5

Only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar. After that, use a spatula to mix everything else in, because if you continue to use a mixer you&#39;ll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture, which will make it less fluffy. Also add the milk and butter before the flour, because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture. If you prefer something less sweet, use 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 2. You could also melt the butter first, before stirring in the milk, just to make it melt faster.",3

I also used regular old all-purpose flour (some have said it&#39;s important to use some kind of special bread flour), and it was perfect: light, fluffy, with a crust that wasn&#39;t too hard--exactly what I wanted.

I discovered that if you cream butter with sugar it will be more of a cake than cornbread. Same as substituting 1 cup cornmeal for 1 cup flour.

The olives and oregano give it some flavor, but this casserole needs the optional beef or even sausage to make it delicious.",3

1,0,5,8,179,"Peanut Butter Cup BarsOkay so i tried making the cups prior  and it was a mess and looked a mess the paper cups collapsed, I couldn&#39;t get them to look perfect.So  this time I decided to make peanut cup Bars for Easter gifts thy look perfect.  So much easier to make and you lessen the risk of not using the chocolate in time for it going all dry and lumpy.I  bought candy/sweet clear bags.  I tripled the amount of mixture.   I used a non stick reusable sheet and lined an oven tray it covered almost half the tray the layers.   I used galaxy bars, no cheap chocolate chips.  So  much smoother a taste for the chocolate really adds to the taste from what i&#39;ve been told and I added Himalayan pink salt to the  mixture of peanut butter.Microwaves are bad for you so i didn&#39;t use one , i don&#39;t have one,  it changes the cellular structure of food and is harmful to dna.  i just used a stainless steel pot  on the cooker, filled with water on 3 and a smaller one on there for the chocolate mix and the the peanut butter mix.I did first layer put in freezer for 20 mins then did the peanut layer, easier to spread it when bottom layer is hard,  same in freezer 20 mins then last layer of chocolate back in the freezer for 20 mins.  Then using a cleaver, I cut it into big bars looks perfect and great.I got 3 pounds 8 ounces worth of bars and 10 big bars out of it.  Much much easier to make these than to try make perfect cups.  Anyone i&#39;ve made these for prior, absolutely lovesssssss the taste.So going  to wrap in greaseproof paper, then in yellow tissue paper inside the bag, then put into the clear bags, tie on yellow ribbons and glue a chick and an egg on ribbon and hand out  for Easter  :)Would be great fora photo upload function.",5

No brown sugar or tomato sauce. I used 1 very large fresh tomato.  I used  a packet of beefy onion soup mix and added some Better Than Boullion Beef base to the mix. I upped the amount of green pepper and used less ground beef. And I used no rice.This is all about the beefy taste wrapped around Green Peppers.It was most enjoyable.TOH-VFE",5

Next time, I&#39;ll reduce the dough on the bottom and add it to the top. I also baked it for 35 minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for another 5 min with the door cracked.

It was the first recipe I tried out.  Someone else mentioned this comment and I fully agree after making a different recipe. The bread is actually too heavy.  Nice flavor but sits heavy and feels heavy. The biggest difference between this recipe and another I tried was how many eggs.  The other recipe I really liked took 3 eggs. I may have said I would make this again but not anymore.,3
1,0,1,0,193,I made this dish tonight for dinner and it was a hit. I used mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Used sharp cheddar and Parmesan cheese and beef ravioli. I also added onion and garlic to the sauce. This will be a dish we have once a month for dinner. Love it!,5

To make it even easier (and the way my grandma did it), is to not brown the meatballs.  Mix the meatball ingredients, shape into meatballs and put in an even layer in a casserole dish and pour the soup mixture over.  Cook at 350, covered,  for 30 minutes. Remove cover and cook for 30 more minutes. Then I put them on top of mashed potatoes, spoon sauce over all and enjoy!

I also use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter in the icing, sticking to the 2 cups of sugar,  which means that they would be slightly less sweet. The frosting just covers them.To the person who asked about a substitute for cannola oil, you can use any kind of oil except for olive.

Both were wonderful and garnered big thumbs up!! Thanks to the other reviewers for suggesting sausage instead of beef, it really added richness to the dish.Other minor changes: I used two types of ravioli: cheese and portabella-cheese. I used one jar of marinara and one jar of vodka sauce and a shredded blend of mozzarella, parmesan, and romano.As far as steps, I followed them exactly, and it was easy as pie (and as tasty!). I couldn&#39;t believe how great both pans looked when I pulled them out of the oven, or how good the kitchen smelled. A keeper for sure!!",5

The only thing I will do different next time is double the sauce and add an additional 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Very, very good.  Really the person who said these were bland have no taste buds.

I cooked my chicken lightly in my skillet with onion/garlic, but then instead of cooking it all on the stove, I put it over into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients. I started this in the morning on high and it was ready in 4 hours. (I chose this method because I am a busy mom and I like to start my meals in the morning and then have all the prep work done for me) I served this up with some cajun bread and we had a wonderful lunch!

Because he enjoys peppers, he used a whole pepper (red &amp; green) rather than just half as suggested.  I&#39;m am surprising him tomro, just finished prep work and marinating in basement fridge. Only need fresh guacamole and a little cilantro and we&#39;re set! Very happy Daddy!",5

1,0,42,31,730,"For what it is it was excellent. It is not “lasagna”, it is a very good “baked ravioli”. I used store bought fresh 3 cheese ravioli and a 24 ounce jar of traditional marinara sauce.  I added two large sliced cremini mushrooms, ¼ cup diced sweet onion, 2 diced garlic cloves, substituted country sausage for ground beef and gave it a few good shakes of Italian seasoning.

I cut the original recipe in half and we ate half of that giving us another meal sometime in the future. There are just two of us so a little goes along way. Served it with some Italian baguette bread to mop up the bottom of our bowls.",5

1,0,4,1,269,"This is a very good recipe for white chili. It is a little thin and more like soup when made exactly as written.  I substitute a cup of heavy whipping cream for one of the cups of chicken broth which gives it a very creamy and thicker sauce.

I added some thinly sliced celery and 2 or 3 finely chopped garlic cloves with the onions and carrots.  I had some whipping cream I needed to use, so I used about 2 1/2 cups 2 percent milk and 1/2 c. whipping cream.

This is my definite go-to recipe for (many) strawberry shortcake every summer....but love just as much plain, out of the oven, with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  Chances are you have every ingredient at home and can whip this up in no time.  Why look for another recipe when you&#39;ve got the best, right here!!",5
1,0,0,0,100,I may never make a regular crust again.  This is a great pie. I added about teaspoon of salt to the filling. Then I added a teaspoon of salt and cinnamon to the crust. Accidentally I put the apples in with the water and starch and it still worked.,5

1,0,4,1,269,"Wow!  I made this cake for the 4th of July (what&#39;s more American than chocolate cake, right?!) and it was a grand slam, home run with everyone!  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I added a generous dash of cinnamon to the batter with the other dry ingredients.  The cake came out exactly like it looks in the picture on the website.  It is so delicious, I can&#39;t stop eating it!  It&#39;s dense (I love dense cakes as opposed to light and airy, spongy cakes), super moist and full of chocolate flavor.  The frosting pairs perfectly with the cake.   The recipe made three full size, 9 inch layers, I just wrapped one layer in plastic wrap and foil and put it in the freezer for another day.  The frosting was more than enough to generously frost two layers, and then have about a cup leftover.  At first I was stumped because I never heard of &#34;leftover frosting&#34; before, not in my house!  This frosting recipe left enough leftover for us spoon-loving-frosting-eating adults, and more for another time!  I bet I could even frost 1/2 dozen cupcakes with the leftover frosting.  So to sum it up, if you love rich, chocolately, moist, dense cake with tangy, sweet, chocolately frosting of which you will have some leftover, then make this cake!  Thank you for sharing, Sandy!  This cake recipe deserves that winning ribbon!",5

I read another comment that said they mixed the heavy cream alone until it was stiff and folded it into the mixed cream cheese and powdered sugar. I would highly recommend using this method.  I also added about a tablespoon of bailey&#39;s into the cream cheese and powdered sugar and it tasted great. I would recommend this recipe.,5

I actually turned on the broiler at the end, made up the fajitas by placing two tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil and preparing two large fajitas to go under the broiler, just until the cheese starts bubbling.  They added salsa and sour cream and wrapped them up.  Sauteing the vegetables in the remaining liquid left from cooking chicken is important.  Cooked until they appear burnt in spots. Incredible!",5

I used a combination of Jonagold and Granny Smith apples but increased the amount of apple to 9 cups.  This was just right for the stated amount of sugar, flour, and seasoning.  Juicy but not runny.  2). Baking time needs to be increased substantially.  I started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done.  Baked another 30 minutes, checking frequently to be sure it was not over baking.  Apples should be nice and &#34;oozy&#34; and very tender.  With these two minor modifications, fabulous results!",5

Put the rice in a bowl and cover with the 1/2 cup water and let it sit for at least 10 mins(I usually get everything else ready and by that time the 10 mins is almost up).

It&#39;s still really good and beats the heck out of canned soups with canola oil and GMO&#39;s in them. I blended it with my immersion blender at the end to make the mushrooms smaller. I did this for use in casseroles and the consistency is great. Next time I might add another tablespoon or 2 of flour to make it thicker, or reduce the liquid. Make sure you wisk the flour into the stock really well before adding it to pot, and boil for a full 2-3 minutes to cook out the flour taste. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future, and next time I will get fresh mushrooms.  Looks like enough for 3 casseroles, so I will freeze the rest. Thanks!",5

You almost have to take them out before they look totally done. Also, for those who had issues with spreading, it&#39;s likely also because of the use of only butter in the recipe. Butter makes cookies flatter. I used half butter, half butter  butter flavored crisco and that did seem to help. I think next time though I would use all crisco though.  I also nearly doubled the spices, I tasted the dough first and it just didn&#39;t have that ginger taste I was going for so I adjusted. Instead of rolling in sugar, I used a hard cookie glaze and dribbled it over them-- came out pretty great!",4

The cake is similar to a pound cake, but not quite.  I sprinkled it with confectioners sugar and will be serving it with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  Next time I will try making cupcakes.

I&#39;d always considered that doing anything to grapes except eating them right off the bunch was gilding the lily, but after tasting this, I decided if you are going to &#34;gild,&#34; this was the gilding to do! I&#39;d never made this myself before today, though. We had a bunch of white grapes that were just a bit too tart for us to enjoy eating by themselves, so I mixed this up. It&#39;s so quick and so easy, and very forgiving of substitutions--I found that I didn&#39;t have sour cream, so used 0% plain Greek yogurt, and then discovered that I&#39;d accidentally grabbed fat free cream cheese at the store, which is a slightly different creature to me than regular or lowfat. And I had no pecans, so I chopped up some almonds. Even with all that, this came out wonderfully, and tasted very similar to what I&#39;ve had in the past at various gatherings.",5

Also, the type of salsa will make a difference too.  I used a thick and chunky type.  Very yummy!",5
1,0,0,1,100,We made these with our own home grown pumpkin - in March.  In place of the cup of oil we used 1/3 cup canola oil and 2/3 cup applesauce.  Came out great.

Each week a team cooks breakfast every Sunday during the year.  My husband and I take turns choosing what we want to fix.  This is high on my list as the cottage cheese makes it so moist and delicious.I vary on the Cheddar cheese and use what I have on hand, sometimes I may add two or more different cheeses when I make a triple batch. I add different meats as well, to the casserole depending what is on sale at the store.  This is always a big hit with our parish of 45 people.We charge a $2.00 donation to cover the cost of the meal and what money is over the cost goes back to the Church.

1,0,11,6,710,A good casserole type recipe. Great flavour and presentation. The pork was of course overdone so I think next time I&#39;d be tempted to just brown one side or perhaps put them in raw and just broil for a couple of minutes at the end. I cut back a little on the broth and added a dollop of cream just to spoil myself.,0

I took this to a potluck without having made the recipe before; that&#39;s always a gamble! I received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe. Tell-tale vote was in the fact that I took home an empty pan! The bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting. I also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used. It gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would.,5

The kids couldn&#39;t get enough of it.  I made 1 and 1/2 batches and it made 14 very full enchiladas.  There were 2 left for today&#39;s lunch and it tasted even better as leftovers.

1,0,7,3,278,"So let me start off by saying that the enchilada filling itself is 5 stars, very very good. Definitly different than what my mom made growing up (chicana) but SOOO GOOD. I rated 4 because using flour tortillas just isn&#39;t a good idea if you want nice crispy enchiladas, I would consider using flour tortillas more of a wet burrito type dish. They get soggy. I used corn tortillas instead (and a bit of advice that makes a world of difference is lightly frying your corn tortillas in oil on each side before placing filling in and rolling, makes them more durable and much more crispy to hold up against the sauce) and for the sauce (if you like it a bit spicy, even if not they have regular sauce) I recommend &#34;El Pato&#34; you can usally find in the mexican section of any store. I use the yellow or green cans both delcious. Also, I chopped up white onion and put on top of the enchiladas before spreading cheese. I also baked uncovered for an extra 5-10 mins to get the edges extra crispy ( mi familia loves it this way!) . Served with a simple red rice my mom used to make and it was delicious! Also, I did use cubed chicken because I used some left over breasts from the night prior but I will definitly be shredding it next time, my family didn&#39;t really dig that. All in all I love the filling recipe, very very good. Will be keeping this one! Thank you :)",4

1,0,1,1,142,"We made this tonight following the recipe basically word for word. I simply doubled the ingredients because I just couldn&#39;t see 1 pound of hamburger filling up three people. We used white instant rice for the recipe and it worked great in my opinion.Two adults and our 16 year old daughter. She ate five of the twenty meatballs that I was able to make for the 2 pounds of burger. I browned in olive oil on medium high heat and basically just browned both sides because the 12&#34; skillet was a little crowded. I removed the browned meatballs to a plate while I disposed of the grease from the pan. I also rinsed the pan with hot water once the grease was gone. I returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with the sauce (2x recipe for me).Simmered on a low bubble for 45 minutes (turning the meatballs a couple times). They were just great. I couldn&#39;t believe my daughter ate five of the twenty I made. My only suggestion is to take the time to make the meatballs evenly sized, and to be sure and mix the ingredients thoroughly before turning into meatballs. I suppose the only thing I changed was that I mixed only 3/4 cup of water to the ground beef and added two eggs. In the sauce I did not add the water at all, just the two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce, 4Tsp of Worchestershire sauce, and 4 Tbsp of brown sugar.15 of the 20 meatballs were eaten. Only due to stomach capacity of 3 satisfied Kansan&#39;s. We will make this more often. So easy!",4

1,0,1,0,193,"Very good with a little tweaking. I added a 1/2 cup of half and half to the cheese sauce and that gave it just the right consistency. I gently stirred the cheddar into the finished sauce off heat until melted, instead of tossing it with the pasta, and that worked out fine. I found it was easier to mix the sauce and the pasta together in a large bowl before transferring to baking dish (11x13 pan worked fine).

I did do a few things differently. I seared 5 chicken breast strips in vegetable oil  that I coated in garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I  was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish. I used one whole can of drained carrotts, and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for. After adding the cubed chicken I cooked prior, the recipe was still enough for 2 pies.

1,0,6,2,284,"I want to be fair with this one as some people may like it so here goes..I made this in a glass pyrex 9 x 13 dish. I bought all of the ingredients as written, but did end up with 2 1/2 cups of coarsely crushed pretzels as I did not want to toss them. It still worked fine and amply covered the bottom of the dish. The crème cheese layer worked best by beating the crème cheese and sugar and then folding in the whip topping, as another reviewer recommended. I was skeptical about the jello layer but followed instructions exactly and it worked fine. I put in fridge after first layer for about 30 minutes. Second layer a bit longer and def spread to edges, as another reviewer wisely recommended. Jello layer chilled for a few hours. Sliced beautifully. Looked pretty on a plate. Did not top with additional whip cream, and honestly it did not need any extra sugar, so that would have mainly been for plating. This is where I have to say, it was way too sweet. no way around it either but I may remove the syrup filled strawberries with fresh. The other steps could perhaps be reduced in sugar, but not eliminated as the sugar serves more than one purpose. SO, aside from being overly sweet, this would be a very nice desert. I would never name this a salad or serve WITH a meal though.",3

Next time I will also broil it for a couple minutes too, like others suggested.One thing I did notice was a distinct sweetness to it.  I think it was a combination of the ketchup and the large amount of corn.  Next time I will cut down on the corn and add in a different veggie (maybe broccoli).  While the sour cream made the &#34;sauce&#34; taste good, I didn&#39;t really get a strong sour cream flavor (info for those who are on the fence about adding in the sour cream).Overall, a good dish, and pretty quick when using leftover or store-bough mashed potatoes.

I have another 8 bananas on the brink so I&#39;ll make a couple more double batches and work out my flaws.

Baked 40 minutes in 7x11 pan &amp; no spills.Turned out great. Served it warm with more half &amp; half. It was more creamy than when I used water in the topping. Everyone loved it. Much faster using canned peaches &amp; still tasted great. Husband loves it both ways.

I used a coconut flour (Mama&#39;s Coconut blend gluten free flour found at tj maxx) so to complement this I used coconut oil and a few flakes of unsweetened coconut on top with pecans. I had a guest staying at my house that was gluten free but all the other guests said they couldn&#39;t tell the difference and gobbled up the bread then asked to take the muffens home!

1,0,0,0,100,I substituted applesauce for the oil and it turned out way too moist.  The toothpick came out clean but the bars actually had a gummy texture. I should try the recipe again as the original recipe reads but honestly I don&#39;t like any recipe with that much oil.  I also tried chocolate chips sprinkled on top of half of the bars (a jelly roll pan makes a lot of bars so I wanted to try them different way).  It was a bad idea. The bars did not have that choc chip pumpkin muffin sense at all. I do agree with many others that the recipe was super easy to put together. At least I have something good to add.,2

In addition, because of the extra banana, I was able to cut the eggs down to one but I did use  a large egg.I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, as my family likes that, but they aren&#39;t necessary as I tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet.

1,0,0,0,100,"Made this for the first time recently to take to a function.  It was a hit!  I recieved requests for the recipe.  I used an extra 1/2 cup of marshmallows, but other than that, I did not alter the ingredients.  However, if you truly use a pan with an interior measurement of 15 x 10, you will need a couple of extra graham crackers (trim with a knife) to fill the small gap at the bottom of pan.  Fill the pan so the graham crackers don&#39;t shift around during baking. As another reviewer suggested, make sure there is an overhang of foil on the short ends for removal from pan, spray the foil with nonstick spray, and do not overcook the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture (only a minute after the butter is melted and sugar is incorporated into the butter).  Watch the baking time carefully after the 12 minute mark.  At 12 minutes, mine had browned only at the edges and not in the middle.  Try to get to an overall golden brown without letting the outside edges get too overdone.  I let it cool for about 15 min and then removed it from the pan by holding the 2 ends of the foil.  I let it cool completely and then cut as directed with a sharp knife.  The pizza cutter idea didn&#39;t work well for me.  I will absolutely make this again.",5

My husband said it was the best banana bread I had ever made in 56 years of marriage.  I made 3 recipes and baked it in 8 mini loaf pans for 40 minutes at 325 convection.

1,0,0,2,100,i done ALOT of changes to fit my weird eating habits... I mixed the salt &amp; black pepper 2gether - so it measured out to 1/4t - I used low sodium bacon bits or crumbles - used a Mexican blend of cheeses - added red &amp; green bell peppers diced - and added the bottom 1/2&#39;s of the green onions to the casserole - sprinkled more of the green onions toppings to the potatoes... EVERY1 loved it! will b making it again... for sure!,5

1,0,0,0,100,My cake totally flopped. I made sure all the ingredients were correct. The cake was only about 1/2&#34; high.  The worst part was I took it to a potluck.  The only thing I can think of was I sprayed the dish with Pam like the receipe said &amp; maybe it got on the sides. Never used spray before to grease a cake dish. Any thoughts on what happened would be appreciated.,0

I did omit the ginger (preference), but next time I&#39;d reduce the nutmeg a bit too.I found it a bit too sweet, but that may have been because I used Gala apples and they were quite sweet.

Very easy to make.  *Since the russet potato slices are thin, I didn&#39;t peel them- which added nutrition and flavor- and it wasn&#39;t noticeable.  The oven temp and cooking time were exactly right.  The potatoes were tender but not mushy.  Unanimous decision to make it an Easter tradition.  Thanks Taste of Home.

There is way too much crust for this recipe, half the amount would be much better.  Also, since these bars have to be stored in the fridge, the chilled crust ended up being hard.

1,0,1,0,193,"I&#39;m going to repeat my review of a while ago.  Don&#39;t waste your time measuring the mashed bananas; I&#39;ve found three bananas works every time--and I dump the rest of the ingredients with the mashed bananas and give the beaters a few spins to mix it all together.  Because the &#34;cake&#34; is sweet enough as is, I never add the frosting, and it&#39;s never missed.  This is a no-fail, moist every time, always praised recipe.  A professional wedding cake baker asked me for this recipe because she was going to replace hers for this one.  You will not be disappointed.",5

Over the years I&#39;ve tweaked a bit, for example, we love garlic so I use fresh garlic in the sauce as well as the meat mixture.  I use Rotel milder tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes. Sometimes I add rice to the meat...I&#39;ve even added sweet corn &amp; black beans a few times.  I left out the sage for years, just because I never cooked with it.  But I started to add it about 5 years ago &amp; it does make a difference.  All around a great recipe that&#39;s easy to modify for your own personal tastes.",5

1,0,0,0,100,I might try this again. It tastes very good but did not come out of the pan after the 10 minute wait. The top broke off and the rest was stuck. They were 8 x 4 non-stick pans that I greased - never had this happen before and I make many different banana breads. Any suggestions would be appreciated - it is a VERY good tasting bread. Should it have been 3 pans? The batter filled up 2 pans. Thanks,3

1,0,0,0,100,"Slight correction on definition of capers... Capers are the unripened flower buds of Capparis spinosa, a prickly, perennial plant which is native to the Mediterranean and some parts of Asia. After the buds are harvested, they are dried in the sun, then pickled in vinegar, brine, wine or salt. The curing brings out their tangy lemony flavor, much the same as green olives.The size of the buds range from tiny (about the size of a baby petite green pea) up to the size of a small olive. The smallest variety from the South of France, called nonpareil, is the most prized and comes with an equally notable price-tag. Larger capers are stronger in flavor and less aromatic.",0

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!</p>",5
1,0,0,0,100,This is a great recipe. I changed it up a bit. I used self rising flour instead of regular and ommited the baking powder. I only used a pinch of salt also. And instead of the milk I used sour cream. I like the tangy taste it gives and a richer texture. My husband was really digging this recipe. He isnt a big sweet eater.

1,0,0,0,100,Great Clam Chowder. Used chicken stock instead of water. Would not use all the juice from the cans of clam or the half and half. The soup thickened  nicely but was just a little thinner than I like when adding the juice and reserved half and half.  Will be my go to  Clam Chowder.,5

I didn&#39;t put the sour cream in it instead I used plain greek yogert.  Also I didn&#39;t have garlic powder but I did have some garlic so i crushed up 3 cloves. I also used 1% milk not whipping cream and I put two cans of bean in and blended up one can of beans so it would be thicker.   Left overs were even better today!,0
1,0,1,1,142,My family loves this recipe.  I do not use the sage.  I add a little ketchup to the meat mixture just cause I like a little tomatoy inside the loaf.    I sometimes poke holes on the loaf so the topping can seep into the loaf.,5

I used the throwaway aluminum container and it worked perfectly fine.  i found it needed to cook a bit longer (but my oven is a bit off).  Couple of tips- when the top was getting a bit brown, i put a piece of aluminum foil on top, and it ruined the beautiful top when i took it off, so i decided to just lower the temp a bit and it seemed to do the trick. next time i wont put any foil on top. also flour the blueberries before mixing in so they dont fall to the bottom :)",5

My recipe calls for almond extract and a little brown sugar in the dressing also but is otherwise the same.

I started at 350 but after reading some reviews lowered the temperature to 325. That made a nice banana bread not burnt.  The bread bakes dark.  Also I baked it for 1 hr 10 min.

I was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didn&#39;t use broccoli since one of my family members doesn&#39;t like it.  I did double the recipe and it was very good! That being said here&#39;s what I did: I put the onion, celery and carrots and 1 cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for 10 minutes.  I then added the potatoes, the rest of the broth, the basil and parsley and simmered for another 10 minutes, until the potatoes were done.  To thicken the soup, I then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the broth/veggies mix, stirring constantly.   I heated the milk and Velveeta in the microwave, stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted.  I added the cheese/milk mix after the potatoes were cooked.  I did not add any salt and I did not use the sour cream.  I ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and I served it in homemade bread bowls.   Very, very good!",4

As for the amount of flour, I think the recipe is only showing you what you will need before you start, like say you only need 5 cups of flour for the bread, what happens if you only have that much flour? You can&#39;t knead the bread so well cuz you ran out, I tested how much I end up using after my dough is ready to be kneaded, and I use almost another whole cup of flour.",5

I have made it more like a main coarse and added green chilies and cooked hamburger, ham or sausage and then then added choice of cheese.  I have also seen people keep in the sugar and serve  it as a desert with ice cream.  I also cook mine at 350 degrees for at least 50 minutes.  I like it to be a little bit brown on the top.  That way you know it is done all the way through.",4

10,0,1,0,193,"I made this recipe twice and the 2nd time around, I purposely made  additional adjustments to it.  I used 1 loaf of Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon Bread and I purposely just used the whole loaf, crusts and all the 2nd time around! I used just 1 package of cream cheese and the 2nd time around, I beat the  8-oz. package of cream cheese with 2/3 cup sugar 5 minutes, then I added 6 eggs and 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract.  I scraped the bottom and sides of bowl and then I added 2 cups of milk.  I used 1 PINT of blueberries for both the casserole and for the blueberry sauce.  For the sauce, I&#39;d added 2 Tbsp. bottled lemon juice and I stirred the sugar and cornstarch together before adding the water, then cooked the 3 minutes until it came to a boil.  I stirred in the blueberries, lowered the heat and cooked 10 minutes or untilthe berries burst. After removing from the heat, I stirred in 1 Tbsp. butter. I think that creaming the sugar with the cream cheese makes this dish more flavorful than just cubing it! I&#39;d spritzed the 13x9x2&#34; baking pan with PAM, used a paper towel to spread the spray around and I&#39;d placed the bread cubes in the prepared pan.  Then I added the berries and poured the milk/egg mixture over the bread cubes and berries.  I did allow the French toast to sit, covered, 8 hours on the 2nd time around and then cut vents in the foil to allow the steam to escape!  I also did allow the dish to sit, covered, 1/2 hour before baking, then I baked, covered, 30 minutes at 350o F. and then uncovered the dish and baked 30 minutes more.  For an added touch, I sprinkled 4 tsp. cinnamon-sugar over top on the 2nd time around!  I think that my 2nd time worked much better-the first time, I felt that I could improve this recipe! Using sugar is better for me than using honey or maple syrup!My first time around, I&#39;d used about 9 Tbsp. maple syrup all together and I&#39;d used 2 cups of milk!  I still stuck to 6 eggs, though and the 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract. The first time around I HAD cubed the 8-oz. package of cream cheese and topped with the remaining bread cubes and blueberries!The sauce is GREAT!   I&#39;m finding that what may work for the original recipe with 1 person-for me, it helped to make these additional improvements to have a dish proudly served!delowenstein",5

1,0,0,0,100,"Simply outstanding.  I&#39;ve made this recipe more than once -- several times at high elevation in Denver, another time at/near sea level in Houston.  I never leave reviews for recipes, but felt the need to pay it forward on this one.  PRO TIP (based on experience and experimentation): use UNBLEACHED bread flour if you want a softer crust.  I&#39;ve used standard, all-purpose bleached flour, but the crust ends up too hard.  It&#39;s almost too difficult to cut through it in the end.  I much prefer the softer crust.  As for the rest of the recipe, follow it.  It&#39;s perfect.  I mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and, literally, a regular fork.  Yes, my arm begins to ache by the time I&#39;ve added the 4th cup of flour.  Also, if you are a bread-baking newbie like I was, I used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the 1st and 2nd rise. ",5

1,0,1,0,193,"Yum! If you like really thick chili, I would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour cream/whipping cream a bit (and maybe the cayenne pepper too then) or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned, but we thought it was really good as written! Just the right spiciness- I can&#39;t tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little &#39;bite&#39; in your mouth after eating it.

1,1,2,0,253,"My husband and I were looking for a good potato recipe, and we stumbled upon this one. Initially, our first thought was, it makes too much for our little family of two, so we decided to cut the recipe in half. It sounded delicious.Once it came out of the oven, that was a different story. The amount of bacon coupled with the sour cream overpowers the dish, so the balance of flavors is too rich. Because the potatoes are such a neutral flavor, they get lost in the casserole. Maybe if you use less of the sour cream and bacon, or more potatoes, that would be the right ratio of bacon to toppings. Also, the presentation wasn&#39;t very appealing, because the whiteness of the sour cream dominates the other colors.Sadly, this recipe will not be added to our recipe box. Happy cooking! :)",2

1,0,0,2,100,"I think this recipe is a great starting point for ginger cookies. The ginger flavor isn’t super noticeable though, if you, like me, crave the warmth of a strong ginger taste. I’ve made a couple modifications to make these cookies healthier and tastier while not compromising the softness of the cookies: 1. Replaced half of the flour with ragi flour. Ragi is a finger millet and has high protein, mineral, and fiber content. 2. Reduced butter to 8 tbsp. With the additions below, there is extra moisture in the batter and no need to use as much butter. You could in fact reduce butter further to 7 or 6 tbsp since I found my batter a little sticky and hard to form into balls. 3. Increased ginger to 3 tsp 4. Added half a cup of shredded coconut 5. Added half a cup of flax seed powder   I haven’t had a problem with the cookies spreading out too thin. In fact I’ve had the opposite issue of them not spreading out enough. It may have to do with where I am located - even in the summer it’s quite chilly. I leave my egg and butter out to let them warm up to room temperature, and use a stand mixer so they get nice and fluffy. I also use molasses which is super sticky, so that may contribute to reducing the spread.",4

1,0,5,1,296,This did not take as long to make as I thought it would.  I did do a few short cuts though.  I didn&#39;t blend the tomatoes and it turned out just fine.  I only simmered the chicken mixture 10 minutes and only left the dish in the oven for 10 minutes after uncovering.  It still was delicious.  Ground beef or sausage could easily replace the chicken.  I&#39;m not a big fan of chicken in red sauces but most dishes of this kind use beef or sausage so the chicken was a nice change of pace.  The chicken could even be shredded or cut very small so it&#39;s not as noticeable.  This could easily be prepared ahead of time for a busy next day.  Prepare the chicken mixture and refrigerate since it&#39;s the step that takes the longest or prepare the entire dish and bake it the next day.  We are a family of 5 and so there is only a few small servings left over.  Next time I may double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8.,4

I discovered that if you cream butter with sugar it will be more of a cake than cornbread. Same as substituting 1 cup cornmeal for flour. You can try this if you want more of a bread texture than a cake. Still it&#39;s an excellent recipe... enjoy ...",5

Pan fried it with a little olive oil enough to sear it. Then add to the potatoes. And I keep it closed the whole time. Bake another 30 min in 325F,5

I did not have any cream only skim milk, and it came out really good for my taste, it had a nice creamy texture, cream may be too heavy for me.  I also had a cooked chicken breast and cut that up and put in as well.  I also used Mrs Dash Onion in it for a little kick.  I think this recipe is very easy, quick, and I will definitely make again, and get more creative with it.  Use more different types of mushrooms, puree some and leave the rest chunky, add some wine.

That being said, even though my first one was a runny mess, I was STILL asked to make it again! I&#39;ve had luck adding 10 mins to the cook time give or take. It should still move in the middle slightly but it shouldn&#39;t be too jiggly. It&#39;s tough to tell with this one when it&#39;s done. When you get it right it&#39;s amazing!",5

1,0,1,1,142,"Oh my Goodness!  This dish is absolutely FANTABULOUS!!!!!  I used 1.5 pounds of shrimp (12 ounces), 1 pound (16 ounce) of REAL jumbo lump crab meat, and 1.5 pounds of bay scallops (12 ounces).  I doubled everything else.  I also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and I added the garlic just before I added the broth and juices.  I used Costco&#39;s fresh, aged parmigiano reggiano cheese.  My sauce was not bland at all!  It was thick, rich and decadent!  Also, in the doubling process, I used an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and an 8 ounce bottle of lobster juice.  Be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isn&#39;t runny.  Additionally, because mine did not brown after 38 minutes of baking, I put it under the broiler for about 2 minutes.  It was perfect!  While the seafood makes the dish costly, it was well worth it!  I will certainly be making it again!",5

So dense in fact that it was raw and runny in the middle and almost burnt on the outside after an hour in the oven.  I have no clue what i did wrong.  I got it to the point of edible in the middle.  I even made a test batch and added more flower because that was slightly too wet.  I think it would do best as two small loaves.  It had a great flavor though and the outside is wonderful.  I need help to make this right!!",3

1,0,2,1,193,Good flavor and texture. Followed recommendation to reduce sugar (I did 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar). Also nutmeg flavor seems a little strong (I would reduce and possibly increase cinnamon if necessary). Make sure you choose to use tart apples to get the best flavor.,4

1,0,0,0,100,Nice comfort food.  I used diced tomatoes with green chilies b/c I couldn&#39;t find the Mexican ones.  The sauce was really spicy in the pan but cooled off in the mix of the casserole.  Served with sour cream and lettuce.  Will add jalapenos next time.,4

Wanted to start a little tradition with my young daughters that they could pass on —making a simple cake from scratch.  While it was a little sweet for my own taste, they absolutely loved it. The texture was spongy and moist, and the plain cake was a hit solo. I also made a berry compote to add a bit of tartness for my own preference (and my mom’s) and the girls loved that too. I guess the key is in proper mixing.    Not a fake review! There were a couple negative reviews from so-called “baking professionals” that said the cake turned out awful or that the positive reviews were not genuine. Real mom here.",5

Also, added two tablespoons of ricotta in with the sauce. Also, used a tiny bit more chicken than called for and to be honest I could have gone with even more chicken in retrospect! I would easily use 2lbs instead of 1 next time!",5

I did change/add quite a bit, but my favorite too to share is this: I saw a lot of people thickening with flour and gagged a little, lol! As a southern cook, my grandma taught me long ago to slowly sprinkle in instant mashed potatoe flakes to soups, etc! You don&#39;t taste the potato, it thickens Instantly and No Lumps!! Anyway... here&#39;s my other many, many tweaks: I used a cold store-bought chicken and sauteed a large, chopped Vidalia onion, half of a chopped red bell pepper, and added fresh, minced garlic to the veggies once they were softened. I didn&#39;t have green chiles, so I added two (Drained!!!) cans of Diced tomatoes with green chiles (one mild and one &#34;Mexican&#34; flavored, YUM!) Also, I had 2 cans of Canellini beans (white kidney beans) instead of great northern. As far as spice... I doubled or tripled the cumin- we like that flavor a LOT- and added a few handfuls of chopped cilantro. Also I seasoned the sauteing veg mix with the yellow Adobo and the Sazon Completa seasonings. Served this with chips, Monterey Jack cheese, guacamole and LOTS more fresh cilantro! So good but...sorry this was so long!",4

1,0,0,0,540,This was a wonderful cake! I say &#34;was&#34; since it didn&#39;t last the weekend! I split the cake batter into two round 9 inch springform pans and used a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges (all the store had at the time) and it produced a moist cake that was light but paired well with the frosting. I had enough frosting left over (my household prefers a lightly frosted cake) to do a five cup salad variation for dessert as well! Will make this again and again!!,5

1,0,0,1,100,"I made this yesterday for my birthday cake.  I used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water, and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  After adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin. I&#39;ve never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it.  I baked 2 layers on the top rack and 1 on the bottom rack.  The top rack cakes were ready at the 30 minute mark so I pulled them out.The cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle, so I moved it to the top rack and baked it another 7 or 8 minutes.  The top of that 3rd layer had a funny darkened pupil-in-an-eyeball sort of center appearance, probably from the jiggling it received when I moved it to the top rack, but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted.  I made my own frosting (a butter &amp; cocoa powder version) that I know is delicious, since some folks mentioned they didn&#39;t like the sour cream flavored icing much.  The cake had a nice dense, moist texture and a great not-too-chocolatey flavor.  It makes a huge cake; mine was 4&#34; tall when assembled, so be sure to cut thin slices!

Saw another recipe that sounded &#34;glorious&#34; , adding honey etc. It was BORING, to say the yeast. Came back to this &#34;original&#34; bread recipe and will be making this one from now on. Like artisan bread of which I make a lot of , my question is this. I love a thick hard crust, Sooooo if I were to open the oven; say at the 3/4 cook time and &#34;spray&#34; cool water on the loaves.....would that thicken the crust?

The only thing I changed is the buttermilk which I substituted to vanilla yogurt since I do not have buttermilk at home. It taste so delicious and moist. I cooked about 1 hr and 10 mins. Cooled it down and wrapped in a foil and placed in the refrigerator and it was perfect ?? yummy ?? banana ?? bread ?? ever...,5
1,0,0,0,100,Okay so I substituted garlic for the powder. And also the beef for ground turkey and instead of spicy sausage I used mild and it was great well the meat sauce. I have my lasagna in the ovenext right now but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be great. :),5

1,0,5,1,296,This was a disaster for me. The jello turned into little balls when I whisked in the yogurt.  The only thing I can think of is that the yogurt was too cold and caused the jello to start to set.  Maybe it would have worked if I had allowed the yogurt to warm up a bit first.  I had to throw it away.,1

1,0,0,0,100,I questioned some of the ingredients but it was fantastic! Should be called a Cheeseburger potato soup.  Tasted like I was eating a baked potato with a cheeseburger on top. The soup also looked like Queso dip which made my kids excited to eat it! :),5

1,0,0,0,100,Great authentic tasting chowder! I used one cup of chicken stock and omitted the bouillon and water. I also found that it needed a little more liquid to thin out so I added more stock until I got the consistency I desired. It was delicious. Will make again.,4

1,0,0,2,100,This is a great recipe. I added diced green chili&#39;s. But don&#39;t think it originated with the Amish as they don&#39;t have electricity to keep frozen hash browns. They live very frugally without electricity.,5

1,0,0,1,100,"Great recipe but with the omissions I deleted 2 stars.  For taste I would give it 4.  I am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes I made below.If someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe, but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize and/or correct the following:Salt:  Salt is necessary UNLESS you are using salted butter.  Most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe.  This recipe may have been written for use with salted butter, but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted, it will come out bland without the addition of salt. I added 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect.Batter: My batter was unusually runny, I would even call it watery. I have made cakes with very runny batter previously, but I was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didn&#39;t mention the consistency of the batter. I added 1/2 cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise. Your results may vary, however.",3

Also, scared for it to be &#34;bland&#34; as I knew I&#39;d be leaving out salt to accommodate sodium-restricted family members, I took the advice of doubling up the other spices. I used mozzarella, provalone and parmesan for the cheeses. This was a HUGE hit with everyone and I love that it seems like this recipe could leave room for a lot of little personal tweaks and substitutions if one so chose to implement any. Definitely committing this to the recipe book!",5

We like a punch of flavor so I add a can of Rotel. I use the emersion blender and all it does is add flavor and it doesn&#39;t change the color. I fried some bacon and we added it as a garnish. Delicious!,5

I think next time I&#39;d go a little lighter on the cheese, add some extra zucchini/squash, and play around with some spices or a little more imaginative of a sauce. Also, I&#39;m having difficulty understanding where the similarity to Pizza is imagined to be.

All that said, I liked it. Plus, as a concept (i.e. Squash/egg/cheese based) it&#39;s a great way to use up the tons of summer squash from the garden.",4

I made the recipe as listed, and then I added an extra glug of buttermilk, a capful of each almond and vanilla extract, and a very ripe banana. Also I didn’t want to wash my 1/3 cup so I eyeballed the brown sugar. I ended up leaving it in the mixing bowl to soften up the oats for Maybe 5-10 minutes while I started coffee and then threw that batter on a griddle, cooked those puppies up, and inhaled 3 while they were still warm and covered in smashed strawberries and blackberries. The recipe made 9 good-sized pancakes that were soft, fluffy, and tasted a little like banana bread. I’m sold.",5

I also chose to beat the cream cheese with the liquid before adding as opposed to doing the cubes, and I added both a little sugar and pure real vanilla. However I agree with some other remarks that it was too eggy.  I could taste the egg more than the other ingredients and the texture was very dense.  Instead of 6 eggs (again I halved) next time I would do 4 but keep everything else the same.  Sauce is good but very sweet, a little goes a long way.  I will definitely make it again, just change the eggs to help the texture be more like french toast than an egg casserole.  I&#39;d give it higher stars if it wasn&#39;t for the eggs.",2

I think any cheese, or mix of cheeses, would be wonderful.This is true comfort food, and I think a great &#34;base recipe&#34; for any number of variations.",5

I grabbed this recipe about an hour before I was to cook and was out of capers, so I searched for a substitution. My google search result recommened subbing with something tangy that has a bit of a bite to it, there were several options. I chose to substitute capers with a spicy baby dill pickle, all it took was one and it worked great! If you use a spicy baby dill, also, be sure to mince it up, really fine, because it spreads the flavor out evenly over the fish, when it&#39;s cut up tiny.  The only other substitution I made was using 1 tsp   fresh minced garlic (= 2 cloves), because I think it tastes better than garlic powder, just my taste preference. Everyone loved this recipe and I definitely will be using it whenever we eat tilapia, in the future! Well done, TOH!",5

The reviews of most of the recipes said they cut the amount of oil and still made a too moist or oily cake.  This is a moist cake, but not too moist.  The batter is stiff until you add the apples.  It easily spread into the pan.  I wanted to taste more apple, so cut the nutmeg in half.  It was perfect.  You can still taste the nutmeg, but it&#39;s not overpowering.  I bought caramel sauce instead of making the butterscotch sauce.  The cake is great even without any sauce.  My husband said this recipe was definitely a keeper!",5

1,0,1,0,193,I made this for my daughter&#39;s birthday. It was amazing. I have been baking for 50 years and never expected such deliciousness from a recipe based on a boxed cake. The frosting was decadent. Instead of making the chocolate lace for the top I used chocolate covered strawberries. I am going to try alter this recipe to make a white chocolate cake. For anyone thinking of trying this recipe...DO IT YOU WON&#39;T BE DISAPPOINTED!,5

It came out perfect. I used a glass bread pan and it took 65 minutes just like the recipe stated. I forgot to add walnuts. I think it would be yummy with some spreadable cream cheese.,4
1,0,0,0,100,I made this last night for supper and it was delicious! I had made a roast the night before so I used my leftover carrots and potatos in this soup. Only thing is for our family next time I will add a bit more hamburger. ,5

I reduced the liquids because I also added 1/2 cup more pumpkin to the loaf.I have baked this recipe both ways and fell equally! This has by far been the best pumpkin bread I have baked.*Note: The best way to keep your bread moist is to turn off the oven when you are a couple minutes from being fully done and letting the pumpkin bread cook slowly for about 5-10 minutes in the turned off oven! Make sure to cover snugly once the pan is cool enough to grab or else it will dry out! Thank you so much for the recipe!",5

1,0,0,0,100,Oh my goodness this is so good and super easy!  The change I did make was not in ingredient but in preparation.  I mixed the salsa and sourcream together which made it much easier to layer than sourcream by itself.  Will definitely make again!,5
1,0,0,0,100,This is a fantastic recipe.  It just gets better and better until the pan is empty.  The pineapple really penetrates the flavor of the cake.  It is so much better the second day.,0

Because I didn&#39;t have any leftover mashed potatoes, I prepared a full bag of Ore-Ida Steam and Mash Russet potatoes. I used 2 packets of low-sodium beef broth because she&#39;s on a low-sodium diet. I used a tad less Worcester sauce, and increased the amount of low-sodium ketchup. but the flavor was still GREAT!

I followed the recipe as directed, but used a whole pound of ground beef, a whole diced onion and a little less than half of a large brick (2lb size) of Velveeta. I also didn’t shred the Velveeta, but cubed it and it melted just fine. Added bacon crumbles for even more flavor. Will be adding this to my winter comfort food rotation...SOOOOO good!",5

After you mix it and if you use Rapid yeast let it rest for 10 minutes then cut in half put in the pan and let rise and turn the oven on and bake them.. Best bread recipe ever..,5
1,0,1,2,127,"The taste was pretty good, but the texture and final look didn&#39;t at all match the picture. There&#39;s not enough coconut in this recipe relative to the egg whites. It turned into a puddle of mess when baking.",2

There are so many ways to tweak this, and the result is always perfect.  I always decrease the oil to 1/4 cup, then add a heaping tablespoon of either vanilla yogurt, sour cream or applesauce to compensate. I also always decrease the sugar by a few tablespoons and you would never know.  Sometimes I add some shredded zucchini, by decreasing an equal amount of banana.  My Mom&#39;s favorite way to enjoy these was warmed in the microwave with a dab of butter.  They are also good with chocolate chips mixed in, or by adding a streusel topping.",5

Rather than slicing and cooking chicken, peppers, and onions, I use Trader Joe’s 12oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen Fire Roasted Peppers &amp; Onions.  I just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe.  When the chicken is done marinating, I just heat up the peppers n onions for about 10 minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and it’s done and delicious.  I also use Trader Joe’s whole wheat low-carb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories.  Doing it this way, total prep and cook time is about 20 minutes, but if you don’t tell anyone they’ll think you actually worked hard making it.  I love cheating.",5

I didn&#39;t have wheat flour so made them with 1 c. all-purpose flour and it worked fine.  I read a review about the cakes being dry.  That is my thought on using wheat flour.  I have never made anything with it that hasn&#39;t turned out terrible dry so I&#39;m wondering if her cakes were dry from the wheat flour and not the oatmeal.Here is something I tried for the first time and I was amazed.  I never buy buttermilk so was reading the other day to see if my method of adding 1 T. lemon juice to 1 c. of milk is a close substitute.  The article said that it is fine but sometimes will give off the taste of the lemon.  They suggested the closest sub to buttermilk is to add 1-1/2 tsp. cream of tartar to the dry ingredients for very cup of milk.  They said it is very hard to find any differences in using that compared to products made with buttermilk.  Maybe that&#39;s why they were so light they nearly floated off the plate!,5

The almond milk tastes no different.    The only thing I noticed was that it made so little soup.

May take a couple times, but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper.  Also, my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we don&#39;t use beef or sausage - just spread pizza sauce over crust, put a think layer of pepperoni on this, then your cheeses and veggies.

Sadly, I should have tried the recipe first as written but so many said that additional sauce was needed.  So rather than double the ingredients, I did a 1.5X the amounts and had enough sauce to sufficiently cover the potatoes.  After an hour, I removed the foil and there was so much sauce/juice that the dish was swimming in liquid.  I literally spooned out all of the extra sauce which easily made up the extra 1/2 that I added.  The potatoes were very tender (used a mandolin for thinner slices) and the sauce was a hit -- delicious.  Next time I would brown the chops and only add to the dish at the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I used 1 inch chops and they turned out dryer than I&#39;d like.

However, like some of the other reviews, I too had a problem with the top icing layer cracking and breaking to pieces when I cut it,  and it didn&#39;t stick to the caramel layer under it. I was dissapointed by that happening and wondered if anyone has a solution to keeping the top icing layer from breaking into many pieces and not sticking to the caramel layer? I followed the directions completely and also followed what the reviewer, spoir10692 wrote on December 22, 2010 to keep the top icing layer from spliting/cracking, and it still didn&#39;t work. I also had a problem of cutting it into nice square pieces since the caramel layer was hard to cut through and it came out in jagged edges. It didn&#39;t look like the evenly cut pieces in the picture at all and I found it took me a long time to made it.  Well, after all this, I still will keep trying to make this turn out right since it was SO delicious and adictive!",4

I went to a baking academy, and I&#39;ve been baking for more than 5 years.) If you&#39;re looking for fluffy hot milk cake, definitely do not try this recipe. If you&#39;re up to really dense, dense, cake, maybe you could try this recipe. Maybe this is why you shouldn&#39;t take recipes from the internet, I highly doubt these good reviews are real as the youtube views for this recipe is considered low.  I won&#39;t be making these again. I&#39;ll try to find other hot milk cake recipes.",1

I added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I also had some trouble with the cornstarch clumping up in the water no matter how long I boiled the water.  So I wound up with a few gummy clumps in my pie.  So next time I make this I would have to add the cornstarch slowly.  Also, I baked mine for 40 mins and it was too long.  My crust was hard and it was darker brown (not like the picture)...but then again, I should have known because that is how my oven is...SO YES, I would definitely make this again and just bake it for less time  and would also solve my cornstarch problem.  The flavor was great WITH the added spices.",4

1,0,3,25,116,Where in the world did a recipe like this come from? Certainly not from the mountains and if it did I would have eaten at your house 1 time and that would have weaned me. Ain’t even close to what a dumpling should be. Balls of dough that you called a dumpling ( ugh).for one thing milk does not go in dumplings at all. A good strong broth is the flavoring of a dumpling   salt and pepper. A cup or two of cool broth to mix with your flour. Rolled out thin on a floured surface and left for an hour or so. Cut with a pizza cutter in 1”x2” pieces and drop into boiling broth and stir gently continuously to keep from sticking. Salt and pepper to taste and you can thicken with a mixture of plain flour and cold water . Add while it’s at a gentle boil while stirring. Turn down to simmer. It’s very easy to over boil and dumplings will fall apart. Do not put a lid on the dumplings. You can add shredded or cut up chicken if you wish.,0

The brown sugar gave it a nice darker color and a chewier crust- which I like.  I used Jumbo eggs and Vanilla Bean Paste.  Before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled chopped walnuts and clear sugar crystals on top of the batter.  When it was done it looked beautiful and had a nice sweet crunch on top.  I will definitely be making this again.  Would make great muffins!",5
1,0,0,2,100,Yummy and a success with the family... used 1% milk and added some lentils to thicken.  Increased pepper as had no  chilli oil .  added crushed coriander seeds cos I like them.

I cut down on the thyme, added maybe an eight of a teaspoon since I don&#39;t like things too heavily seasoned. Also, I halved everything as I just wanted one pie.  Delish!!

Turned out exactly as I had envisioned. 
Oh, who came up with “35 min prep time”??. This was time consuming, but so is any homemade dish that requires this much cutting, blending, sautéing, etc. Be prepared for a cpl of hours. It was worth it.

1,0,0,0,100,"I made this on a Sat. for 8 people.  19 yr. old grandson that doesn&#39;t eat veggies. ask if it had carrots in it!  He went back for seconds and ask on Sun. if there was any left that he could have for supper on Mon. night.  I didn&#39;t have basil or parsley so left out.  Used 8 oz. shredded Mexican chees and 8 oz. shredded co jack instead of Velveeta.  will be making this a lot this winter.    I used a full pound of hamb.  On Mon. I added a pint of home canned potato soup mix, a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls.  Potato soup mix is:  in a pint jar put  1/2 pint jar chopped potatoes, 1/4 pint sliced carrots, split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and fill with water.  Pressure can at 10 pounds for 20 minutes.  This makes a pretty jar for a gift also.  Put the instructions on it.To use heat soup mix with 1 Tablespoon butter or marg. and add one pint milk, check the salt and add pepper if you like.  Heat but don&#39;t boil.  If you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt. jar with 1 teaspoon of salt and pressure at 10 lbs. for 25 minutes.  You can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time.  These are handy to fry or add to soup.",5

I used only ¼ tsp each of the hot pepper sauce and cayenne pepper to suit our personal tastes, and I found Andouille sausage at our local supermarket.  Served it on a bed of Jasmine long grain rice.

Everyone said that I&#39;d have to make that everytime we get together. And no one even guessed or realized that it was gluten free, a true feat for us Celiacs! :) (Note, it&#39;s also a meal unto itself, so as a celiac at a social function, you know you can have a full meal in just the one safe dish!)",5

We lived near Cajun country, and although this is not what they would call authentic, it sure is good. Be sure to use quality Andouille sausage. It makes a big difference.

It is amazing how many things you can do with this recipe even using sea food.  For the baked chicken pie, my grandmother always added a few hard boiled eggs, diced.  Made the gravy silky and adds a extra punch.  She also made gravy on the side in the event someone wanted their&#39;s extra moist.  You cannot make and freeze these if you use hard boiled eggs.  I make multiple small ones in the aluminum pans and freeze them.  They are great to pull out and heat when it&#39;s snowing outside!!",5

1,0,0,0,100,"Great basic bread recipe. Easy even if you are so so at following directions. I left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo. Not too many bubbles for me on the yeast either, but again, turned out like the photo. I baked 35 minutes. The hollow sound didn&#39;t sound hollow to me, it sounded dense to me but then again I don&#39;t know what to listen for as an amateur. Either way, it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part. This really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture, talk about diluting the mixture with garbage! The store bread you pay $2 or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality. It is worth way less than that and I made this quality bread for about 1.66  per batch . 83 cents per loaf at 33 cents for yeast, 2.50 for 5 lb bag flour, divided., at 3 1/3 cups per pound, using 6 1/4 cups. You could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isn&#39;t necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make A LOT of bread before the yeast expires. I&#39;d experiment by putting Everything Seasoning on the top of it, Caraway seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seed pits, the list goes on. The bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty, not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap! Good luck! Youtube: LCatRN",5

I can flip it every so often in the fridge til dinner time, instead of stirring it.I&#39;ve made it several times since then, and we&#39;ve enjoyed it. We enjoy a hint of vinegar (lime juice, or other acidic) to cut down on the overall sweetness, so I did add that, in the additional makings.  I also cut down on the sugar ever so slightly (personal preference, not the recipe&#39;s fault).To make the slaw the star, we make tortillas on these hot summer nights, using this slaw, a tortilla wrap, and leftover grilled pork (though shrimp, fish, or chicken are all okay, too).Thanks for sharing this recipe.

1,0,0,0,100,This is the best lasagna recipe I have come across....I have modified it a bit when I make it.  I only use one can of tomato paste I feel that when you use two it has too much of a metallic taste (especially when eating leftovers) and it also makes the sauce too thick and reheated leftovers are too dry.  I also use slightly more tomato sauce and use two 15 oz cans of sauce.  I am not a huge sausage fan so I usually omit the sausage and just use the 1 lb of beef.,5

I made some minor edjustments - I used the 3 cups of chicken stock to boil the carrots and potatoes, and reserved the liquid to add back in later. I only added 3/4 cup of flour instead of 1 cup.

1,0,2,5,136,"Not many recipes have 258 reviews! I made this for supper for my adult son and I the other night. I had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title. I used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms from Costco - which I fried with the onions - in the same pan as I had fried the bacon (I used low sodium), separately. I added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper (my son loves it) but didn&#39;t add salt as I felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough. Seeing as I hadn&#39;t made this before I didn&#39;t make any other changes - unusual for me. It was a wholesome meal! I accompanied it with a dish of stewed, herb and spice whole tomatoes - but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available - I might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings. I will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes I make. Another reviewer&#39;s comment about using salsa is an option. Before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so I sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese. I was pleased with the result (I don&#39;t like food as hot/spicy as my son), and my son thought it was an improvement. He wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish - adding a bit more of both than I&#39;d put on the one I reheated. Obviously a personal preference. He also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies. I&#39;ll also add the whole 500g container of cottage cheese (that&#39;s 1/2 cup more than in this recipe), as we both love cheese.  Really pleased to find this recipe  - thanks Beth Notaro for sharing! It reminds me of an Old Order Mennonite friend I had who died too early a few years ago with cancer. I&#39;m sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be making this countless times with numerous variations - as well as ones close to the original. I like the idea that it&#39;s bread and gluten free as I have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten.",5

I added the salt after I melted the cheese just because  I didn&#39;t have a full cup of cheddar and made up the difference with processed cheese which tends to be saltier.  In fairness, the recipe states after you uncover the potatoes that the cooking time will be 30 - 40 minutes or longer if your potatoes aren&#39;t tender.   In my experience, it does usually ends up taking about two hours.  Is it my oven, the thickness of the potatoes, or the type of potato?  Who knows!

The only tweek I made was to follow the  suggestions of sprinkling lemon and sugar on the peaches, letting sit half and hour and using the bit of juice that accumulated in with the water part of the recipe. I don\&#39;t think it made that much difference so following spot on should come out just as well. I didn\&#39;t know what would happen with that water formula.

The bread was more moist than I have ever had in any banana bread!  So I used honey and coconut oil instead of sugar and canola oil.  I also added way more applesauce than is called for.  Banana bread should be more of the consistency of something you can pour out into a baking pan.  Initially the batter was too thick to pour out but as I added applesauce, it became pourable and spreadable.  Otherwise I really like the recipe and I only added walnuts, not chocolate just walnuts and it was refreshingly not too sweet but just right and like I said really moist! Delicious!",5

1,0,4,1,706,I too used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and bouillon as this would be my preference.  I had a problem getting my diced potatoes to consistently soften up so the next time I make it I will be sure to cook them in a separate pan and add them in at the last minute with the cheese and ham.  This was a good use of some leftover ham steak and I also had two leftover ears of sweet corn I used rather than the canned corn.  I could have used an extra ear.  My only other substitution was to use two 4 oz blocks of Velveeta cheese cubed up as I did not have shredded cheese on hand and this melts in better anyway.  It is tasty and no celery that my husband would prefer I not use!,0

Third, cheddar is nice, but I also threw in some store-bought 4-cheese pizza cheese.  I also used some on top during the uncovered baking time -- nice lightly browned top.  Fourth, Imade this a one-dish meal: a layer of sauce, a layer of potato + a bit more sauce and a layer of sliced baked ham + a bit more sauce, another layer of potatoes and the rest of the sauce.  The baking instructions (adjusted a bit for a convection oven) were spot on; the covered cooking time; I added the extra chees on top, then did the uncovered baking time (again, adjusted downward for a convection oven).  A quick (and gentle) stire after a short time sitting just after coming out, brought the sauce together neatly and the result was very satisfactory.",4

I used lower sodium chicken broth and black beans and it was still salty enough for us.  I also substituted a can of mild diced tomatoes with chiles for the regular diced tomatoes.  I noticed one reader said that the recipe turned out too soupy.  Try taking the lid off and cooking it on high a little longer in the crick pot or simmering it with the lid off for a few minutes on top of the stove.  My husband and son both rated this a 5.

A quick tip to make sure that the cake has a good bake (or to make any cake bake well) is to have room-temperature liquids/soft solids. I allow the butter, eggs, and sour cream to get to room temperature before using them. I always keep my vanilla extract at room temperature. I also used cake flour and follow the tips on the cake flour box about how to compensate for all-purpose flour (it does make a difference for cakes, I promise.) While the batter does get more liquidy after adding the water, I wonder if Esteli had the oven pre-heated to the right temperature?If you don&#39;t prefer the frosting there are THOUSANDS of frosting recipes out there.

I used a half sheet pan, I think 15-1/2 x 11-1/4, and it was the perfect size for bar thickness. Baked mine for 23 minutes, rotating pan with 8 minutes left. One rack lower than middle of oven. Nice medium brown on top. Put in the cold garage to cool quickly. I had about 1-1/2 cups of leftover cream cheese frosting I&#39;d used for cookies. Very thick so added maybe a good half a cup of soured milk till the right consistency for a glaze. Spread over the mostly cooled bars, cut into 40 bars which yielded 2 inch sized bars. They were gobbled up at church and we still had some to bring home. My family loved them! These will be my go to banana recipe. I loathe making banana bread so these are banana goodies I will make often.",5
1,0,0,0,100,<p>I have already written something about this recipe but I have to write again.  Previously I used my mom&#39;s zucchini recipe and this frosting recipe.  I decided to try this recipe just as it is written and they were incredible.  I did not drain the zucchini either...and there was a lot of liquid too.  This is how good they are...I first made them and accidentally added 1 third cup sugar instead of 1 and a third cup ( my bad handwriting).  My 6 nephews and nieces ran in from outside and grabbed one even though I told them what I did.  They were all gone in less then 5 minutes!!!  I personally didn&#39;t care for them but they still raved about how good they  were.  I then made a second batch...to me it was much better:))</p>,5

I ended up making a few changes by accident, I could not find a green bell pepper so we used the sweet red and orange pepper.  I did not have chicken thighs on hand so I used chicken breasts - I used 1.5 pounds. I added 2 cups of gluten free penne pasta.  Along with the spices (except red pepper flakes) mentioned to use I also added Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and black  pepper - did not measure just eyed it when added. I also added 1 cup of sodium free chicken broth due to the extra half cup of pasta. Cooked as instructed and the remaining uncovered was cooked for only 15 minutes. I did forget to add the romano cheese, no one really noticed. I will make this again and add into our rotation.  we paired this with a nice spinach salad. Looking forward to left overs.",5

The changes and additions I made are for the proteins I used 4 boneless chicken thighs diced and browned in pot. 2 chicken sausage links with sun dried tomatoes browned in skillet then sliced.. For the water I used more chicken broth.. I also added 2 large carrots sliced and a mid to small zucchini halfed   length ways and sliced . I half the amount of garlic and added salted to taste (prob about 1/2 teaspoon) and I added the sausage at the same time as the tortellini,5

Personally, I used more lemon juice and a little less cummin. But since i like a little spice, I used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing. Fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too! I&#39;ve made it twice now and both times it&#39;s came out super delicious!",5

My husband and our 3 boys also loved the flavor. This cake is very moist. I won&#39;t ever buy another box cake again. Now...the frosting...not very good. It tasted waxy and like shortening. It turned out just as stated but doesn&#39;t compare to buttercream. I used this frosting recipe the first time I made the cake and was disappointed in it. The second time I made it and used a vanilla meringue buttercream and it was perfect. Thank you for the wonderful cake recipe!,5
1,0,0,0,100,OMG!!! This cake is awesome!  Key to getting the frosting right is to make sure the whipping is really cold. Recommend putting in the freezer for about 15 mins before you use it.  I will totally make this again!  Enjoy!,5

I double the peanut butter mixture and use regular cupcake paper and put a layer of chocolate down, then a nice size dollop of the peanut butter mixture, then more chocolate.

Then take scissors and cut the remaining paper above the chocolate off. This will make the original size peanut butter cups. These are so much better then the store bought ones and well worth the work!!",5

I omitted the celery seed as DH does not like it, but I minced a small rib of celery and cooked it with the potatoes and other veggies. Instead of doubling the parsley flakes, I added 1Tbsp. dried parsley flakes and 1 Tbsp dried minced chives. I added equal amounts of melted margarine with the flour in a separate pot, then added the milk and cheese to make a cheese sauce. Once that was all thickened and cheesy, I added it to the potato/veggie mixture. It was great, and I will make it again!",5

1,0,3,0,297,What a delicious cake! I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch round cake pan. I baked it 25 mins.  Probably could have used another couple of minutes. And I should have used butter and flour in the pan instead of spray (it did stick). But my son and I were instantly addicted! My only changes were using whole milk (all I had) and adding a pinch of salt (and btw...I also used regular salted butter too). This came together so quickly! And it is perfect eaten warm!,5

Also, the top browned quickly but that was mitigated by putting a piece of foil over top. Unfortunately the bread was still gooey underneath even after 70 minutes so I scooped it into plates and microwaved it to firm it up.

The sauce was hard to pour so that each sandwich got a similar amount of stuff, but in the end after baking, it all evened out in the pan.  I put them in the fridge for a good part of the day &amp; not overnight &amp; they were fine.  Make the sauce first, assemble the sandwiches &amp; pour your sauce.

We don&#39;t really care for Swiss cheese and we couldn&#39;t find Gruyere, so I subbed about 3/4 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano and I used scallions instead of white, sweet onion because they give egg dishes a metal taste.

I had frozen some homemade chicken stock,  (which I always save when I am making enchiladas or casseroles with cooked chicken) and milk in place of water and bouillon, and as I only had 2 cups cheddar when I made it the first time, I added a cup of Colby-Jack I had on hand.
